I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and then use the `reqwest` crate to send a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to do this.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. Can someone help me out?\n\nThanks!\n\nComment: You need to add the `serde` dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file, because you're using `json!` macro which is provided by `serde_json` crate.
