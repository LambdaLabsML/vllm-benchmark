It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and then use the `reqwest` crate to send a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to do this.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. Can someone help me out?\n\nThanks!\n\nComment: You need to add the `serde` dependency to your `Cargo.toml` file, because you're using `json!` macro which is provided by `serde_json` crate. Also, you need to add `serde::Deserialize` trait to your structs that you're using in your request and response.

Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition will be a string that the user can input. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return the result.\n\nHere is the updated version of the Filters part:\n\nFilters\n------\n\nThe following filters are available to filter the data:\n\n* **Name Filter**: Filters the data based on the name of the data.\n* **Type Filter**: Filters the data based on the type of the data.\n* **Date Filter**: Filters the data based on the date of the data.\n* **Value Filter**: Filters the data based on the value of the data.\n* **Custom Filter**: Filters the data based on a custom condition.
