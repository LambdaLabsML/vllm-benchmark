In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and focus for your business.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\n4. I've run `cargo run` and it prints the contents of my clipboard to the console.\n\nNow, I'm not sure how to use the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud. I've looked at the documentation for the `reqwest` crate, but I'm not sure how to use it to make a request to the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction\n\nHere's the relevant part of the documentation for the `reqwest` crate: https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/struct.Client.html#method.post\n\nThanks in advance!", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition will be a string that the user can input. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return true or false.\n\nHere is the updated version of the Filters part:\n\nFilters\n------\n\nThe following filters are available to filter the data:\n\n* **Name Filter**: Filters the data based on the name of the data.\n* **Type Filter**: Filters the data based on the type of the data.\n* **Date Filter**: Filters the data based on the date of the data.\n* **Value Filter**: Filters the data based on the value of the data.\n* **Custom Filter**: Filters the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition is a string that the user can input.
