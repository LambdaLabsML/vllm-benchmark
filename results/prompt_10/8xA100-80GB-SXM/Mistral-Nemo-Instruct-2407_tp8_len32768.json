I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and the `reqwest` crate to make a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to put it all together.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. I'm not sure how to handle the response from the elevenlabs.io api and play the audio. I'm also not sure if I need to use any other crates or if there's a better way to do this.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation for reference: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/docs/text-to-speech>", " and understand.

A pull is a feature that is pulled by the user, because the user has asked for it.\n\nFor example, if you are building a website, a push might be a new feature that you add to the website, without any user having asked for it. A pull might be a feature that you add to the website, because a user has asked for it.\n\nIn other words, a push is a feature that is added to the product without any user input, while a pull is a feature that is added to the product because of user input.", "", " How to create a react app and node and express js web app for creating or add dummy data and show and How I can deploy the code after create build.
