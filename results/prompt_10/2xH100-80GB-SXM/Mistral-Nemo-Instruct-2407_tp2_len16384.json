In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and the `reqwest` crate to make a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to put it all together.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. I'm not sure how to handle the response from the elevenlabs.io api and play the audio. I'm also not sure if I'm using the `reqwest` crate correctly.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation for reference: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/docs/text-to-speech>", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition will be a string that the user can enter. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return true or false.\n\nHere is the updated version of the Filters part:\n\nFilters\n------\n\nThe following filters are available to filter the data:\n\n* **Filter by ID**: Filters the data by the ID of the data. The ID is a unique identifier for each data item.\n* **Filter by Name**: Filters the data by the name of the data. The name is a string that is used to identify the data item.\n* **Filter by Date**: Filters the data by the date of the data. The date is a string that represents the date of the data item.\n* **Filter by Status**: Filters the data by the status of the data. The status is a string that represents the current status of the data item.\n* **Filter by Category**: Filters the data by the category of", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.
