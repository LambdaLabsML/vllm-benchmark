It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the importance of having a clear vision and a plan to achieve it. The book is divided into four sections: Vision, People, Data, and Issues. In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation. It helps you stay", "\n\nI'm trying to create a rust app that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts. I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and the `reqwest` crate to make a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to put it all together.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. Can someone help me create a rust app that supports the elevenlabs.io api and that can read the contents of clipboard aloud using tts?\n\nThank you!", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition will be a string that the user can enter. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return true or false.\n\nHere is the updated version of the Filters part:\n\nFilters\n------\n\nThe following filters are available to filter the data:\n\n* **Name Filter**: Filters the data based on the name of the data.\n* **Type Filter**: Filters the data based on the type of the data.\n* **Date Filter**: Filters the data based on the date of the data.\n* **Value Filter**: Filters the data based on the value of the data.\n* **Custom Filter**: Filters the data based on a custom condition entered by the user.\n\nAdditional Filters\n------------------\n\nIn addition to the standard filters, the following additional filters are available:\n\n* **Custom Filter**: Filters the data based on a custom condition entered by the user. The custom condition is a string that the user can", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.
