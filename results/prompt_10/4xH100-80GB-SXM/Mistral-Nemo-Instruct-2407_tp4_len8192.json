It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the importance of having a clear vision, goals, and a plan to achieve them. It also helps you understand the importance of having a team that is aligned with your vision and goals.\n\nIn the book, Gino Wickman talks about the importance of having a clear vision and goals for your business. He says that without a clear vision and goals, it\u2019s like trying to drive a car without knowing where you\u2019re going.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support tts, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it with the elevenlabs api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and the `reqwest` crate to make a request to the elevenlabs api, but I'm not sure how to put it all together.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. I'm not sure how to handle the response from the elevenlabs api and play the audio. I'm also not sure if I'm using the `reqwest` crate correctly.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nHere's the elevenlabs api documentation for reference: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/docs/text-to-speech>", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == 'column':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'row':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'custom':\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\nCan someone explain it to me?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it. A pull is a feature that is pulled by the user, because they have asked for it.", "", " How to create a react app and node and express js web app for creating or add dummy data and show and How I can deploy the code after create build.
