It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the importance of having a clear vision and a plan to achieve it. The book is divided into four sections: Vision, People, Data, and Issues. In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and focus for your business.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I'm new to rust and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction>\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHere's an example of how the elevenlabs.io api can be used in python:\n\n```\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"xi-api-key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n}\n\ndata = {\n    \"text\": \"Hello, world!\",\n    \"voice_settings\": {\n        \"stability\": 0.5,\n        \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\n\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(response.content)\n```\n\nI want to create a similar app in rust that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == 'column':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'row':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'custom':\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it. A pull is a feature that is pulled by the user, because they have asked for it.", "", " How to create a react app and node and express js web app for creating or add dummy data and show and How I can deploy the code after create build.
