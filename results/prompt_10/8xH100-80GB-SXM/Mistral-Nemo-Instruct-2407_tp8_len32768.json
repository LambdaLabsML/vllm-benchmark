It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the EOS (Entrepreneurial Operating System) and how to implement it in your business. The book is divided into two parts: the first part is about the concept of EOS and the second part is about how to implement it in your business.\n\nThe book is a great resource for entrepreneurs and business owners who want to take their business to the next level. It provides a clear and concise framework for implementing EOS in your business, and it includes real-life examples and case studies to illustrate the concepts.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Traction by Gino Wick", "\n\nI'm trying to create a rust app that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts. I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I'm new to rust and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction>\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHere's an example of how the elevenlabs.io api can be used in python:\n\n```\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"xi-api-key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n}\n\ndata = {\n    \"text\": \"Hello, world!\",\n    \"voice_settings\": {\n        \"stability\": 0.5,\n        \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\n\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(response.content)\n```\n\nI want to create a similar app in rust that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == 'column':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'row':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'custom':\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding what a push and a pull are in the context of jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be Done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.
