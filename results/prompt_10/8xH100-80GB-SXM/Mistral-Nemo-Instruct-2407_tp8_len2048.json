It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the importance of having a clear vision and a plan to achieve it. The book is divided into four sections: Vision, People, Data, and Issues. In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be clear, concise, and inspiring. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation. It helps you stay", "\n\nI'm trying to create a rust app that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts. I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to be a good fit for this, but I'm not sure how to use it in a rust app. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents().unwrap();\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console. However, I'm not sure how to use the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I would greatly appreciate it.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: https://docs.elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/tts/text-to-speech\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api endpoint for text-to-speech: https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}\n\nHere's an example request to the elevenlabs.io api using curl:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \\\n  https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM \\\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \\\n  -H 'xi-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY' \\\n  -d '{\"text\": \"Hello, world!\"}'\n```\n\nI would like to use the `reqwest` crate to make requests to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to do this. I would also like to use the `tokio` crate to make the requests asynchronous, but I'm not sure how to do this either.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!\n\nHere's an example of what I would like the final app to do:\n\n1. Read the contents of the clipboard using the `clipboard` crate.\n2. Make a request to the elevenlabs.io api using the `reqwest` crate to convert the text to speech.\n3. Play the audio using the `rodio` crate.\n\nI would like the app to be asynchronous, so that it can read the contents of the clipboard and make the request to the elevenlabs.io api at the same time. I would also like the app to be able to handle errors gracefully, so that it can print an error message to the console if something goes wrong.\n\nThank you for your help!", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == 'column':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'row':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'custom':\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding what a push and a pull are in the context of jobs-to-be-done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs-to-be-Done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.
