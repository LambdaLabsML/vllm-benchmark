It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the importance of having a clear vision and a plan to achieve it. The book is divided into four sections: Vision, People, Data, and Issues. In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation. It helps you stay", "\n\nI'm trying to create a rust app that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts. I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I'm new to rust and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction>\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHere's an example of how the elevenlabs.io api can be used in python:\n\n```\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"xi-api-key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n}\n\ndata = {\n    \"text\": \"Hello, world!\",\n    \"voice_settings\": {\n        \"stability\": 0.5,\n        \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\n\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(response.content)\n```\n\nI want to create a similar app in rust that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition will be a string that the user can input. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return the result.\n\nHere is the updated version of the Filters part:\n\nFilters\n------\n\nThe following filters are available to filter the data:\n\n* **Name Filter**: Filters the data based on the name of the data.\n* **Type Filter**: Filters the data based on the type of the data.\n* **Date Filter**: Filters the data based on the date of the data.\n* **Status Filter**: Filters the data based on the status of the data.\n* **Custom Filter**: Filters the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition is a string that the user can input. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return the result.\n\nAdditional Filters\n------------------\n\nIn addition to the standard filters, the following additional filters are available:\n\n* **Custom Filter**:", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\nCan someone explain it to me?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.
