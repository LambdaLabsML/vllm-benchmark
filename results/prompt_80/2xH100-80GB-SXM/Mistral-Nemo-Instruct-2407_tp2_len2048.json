I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support tts, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it with the elevenlabs api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and the `reqwest` crate to make a request to the elevenlabs api, but I'm not sure how to put it all together.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    if status.is_success() {\n        println!(\"Success: {}\", status);\n    } else {\n        println!(\"Error: {}\", status);\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right approach, or if there's a better way to do this. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the elevenlabs api documentation for reference: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/docs/text-to-speech>", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == 'column':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'row':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'custom':\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. You'll need to use a 10K Ohm potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD. One end of the potentiometer should be connected to VCC, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD. The other pins of the LCD should be connected as follows: RS to digital pin 12, EN to digital pin 11, D4 to digital pin 5, D5 to digital pin 4, D6 to digital pin 3, and D7 to digital pin 2 [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n\n2. **Software Setup:**\n   - Install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library, which allows you to control the LCD using only four data lines. To install the library, open the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries. Search for \"LiquidCrystal I2C\", find the library by Frank de Brabander, and click Install [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n3. **Arduino Code:**\n   - Here's a sample", " The most quoted verse in the Bible is John 3:16, which says, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"", " I have a list of objects and I want to sort them by a property in case sensitive way.

Here's a step-by-step process of a product designer:\n\n1. **Empathize and Research:**\n   - Understand the user: their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. This can be done through user interviews, surveys, and observations.\n   - Research the market, competition, and industry trends to identify opportunities and gaps.\n   - Gather and analyze data to inform your design decisions.\n\n2. **Define the Problem:**\n   - Based on your research, clearly define the problem you're trying to solve. This should be user-centered and address a genuine need or pain point.\n   - Create a problem statement that guides your design process.\n\n3. **Ideate:**\n   - Brainstorm a wide range of creative ideas and solutions. Encourage wild ideas and quantity over quality at this stage.\n   - Sketch, draw, or use other visual tools to explore and develop your ideas.\n   - Consider different design approaches, such as biomimicry, lateral thinking, or design thinking.\n\n4. **Prototype:**\n   - Choose the most promising ideas from your ideation phase and create prototypes. The fidelity of the prototype will depend on the stage of the design process. Early on, low-fidelity sketches or models may suffice, while", "\n\nI'm looking to generate Apache Airflow configuration code for supporting Azure Active Directory SSO tokens.

Can someone explain how they work and how to use them?\n\nComment: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1402891/what-are-polyfills\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nPolyfills are used to provide functionality that is not available in a certain browser. They are used to make sure that your code works in all browsers. They are usually used to provide functionality that is not available in older browsers.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to use the `Array.prototype.forEach` method in your code. This method is not available in Internet Explorer 8 and earlier. So, you can use a polyfill to provide this functionality in those browsers.\n\nHere is an example of a polyfill for `Array.prototype.forEach`:\n\n```\nif (!Array.prototype.forEach) {\n", " They are all very close and they are all very good friends.

This type of trading is particularly beneficial for refiners due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Cash Flow**: Asset backed trading allows refiners to unlock the value of their assets, such as inventory, equipment, or even future production, to secure immediate cash. This can significantly improve their cash flow, especially during periods of tight liquidity.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: By using assets as collateral, refiners can mitigate the risk of default by their counterparties. If the counterparty fails to meet their obligations, the refiner can seize the asset to recover their funds.\n\n3. **Access to Financing**: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with access to financing options that might not be available through traditional lending channels. This can be particularly useful for smaller refiners or those operating in challenging market conditions.\n\n4. **Hedging Against Price Volatility**: By pre-selling their production or inventory, refiners can hedge against price volatility in the oil market. This can help stabilize their revenue and protect against sharp price drops.\n\n5. **Enhanced Creditworthiness**: The use of", " If you need more information ask for it.\n\nBased on the provided data, the current pH level is 8.0, which is above the maximum accepted value of 7.5.

I'm trying to figure out how to make people understand the importance of taking it daily. I'm not sure how to approach this. Any suggestions?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI think you need to understand the consumer's perspective. Why would they want to take your supplement? What problem does it solve for them? What benefit does it provide?\n\nOnce you understand that, you can then communicate that benefit in a way that resonates with your target audience. For example, if your supplement is for joint health, you might want to talk about how it can help people stay active and enjoy their favorite activities without pain.\n\nYou could also consider offering a subscription service where the supplement is delivered automatically each month. This can help ensure that people don't forget to take it and also makes it more convenient for them.\n\nAnother approach is to educate consumers about the importance of daily supplementation in general. You could create content (blog posts, videos, infographics) that explains why it's important to take supplements every day and how they can support overall health and well-being.\n\nFinally, you could consider offering a money-back guarantee to give people the confidence to try your supplement risk-free. This can be a powerful way to overcome any hesitation or skepticism they may have.\n\nHope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.\n\nComment: Thanks for your answer.

I have another JavaRDD consists of top frequent queries. For each record in onsite attributed data, if the query is present in top frequent queries dataset and if it's first time the system would count this as a cache miss, send a request to retrieve such query and cache in the memory for 12 hours. Then next time the same query comes, it would be a cache hit. I am using Spark 2.1.0.\n\nComment: Please edit your question to include this information.

Here is a sample code:\n\n```\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.*;\n\npublic class CacheHitRate {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()\n                .appName(\"CacheHitRate\")\n                .master(\"local[*]\")\n                .getOrCreate();\n\n        // Load your data\n        Dataset<Row> onsiteAttributedData = spark.read().parquet(\"path/to/your/data\");\n        Dataset<Row> topFrequentQueries = spark.read().parquet(\"path/to/your/topFrequentQueries\");\n\n        // Join onsiteAttributedData with topFrequentQueries on query field\n        Dataset<Row> joinedData = onsiteAttributedData.join(topFrequentQueries, onsiteAttributedData.col(\"query\").equalTo(topFrequentQueries.col(\"query\")));\n\n        // Add a new column to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss\n        Dataset<Row> withCacheHit = joinedData.withColumn(\"cacheHit\", when(col(\"query\").isin(joinedData.select(\"query\").distinct().collect().toArray()), true).otherwise(false));\n\n        // Calculate the hit rate\n        Dataset<Row> hitRate = withCacheHit.groupBy(\"cacheHit\").agg(count(\"*\").as(\"count\"), countDistinct(\"query\").as(\"distinctQueries\"));\n        hitRate.show();\n\n        spark.stop();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will join your `onsiteAttributedData` with `topFrequentQueries` on the `query` field. Then it adds a new column `cacheHit` to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss. Finally, it calculates the hit rate by grouping by `cacheHit` and aggregating the count of records and the count of distinct queries.\n\nComment: Thanks for your help. I have a question. How can I add a new column to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss? I am not sure how to do that.\n\nComment: I have updated the code to add a new column to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss.", "\n )\n}\n\nI get this error when I run the code:\n\n./pages/tomorrow.js\nModule not found: Can't resolve './components/UI/Button' in '/Users/username/Documents/Projects/nextjs-project/pages'\n\nI have a Button.js file in the components/UI folder.
