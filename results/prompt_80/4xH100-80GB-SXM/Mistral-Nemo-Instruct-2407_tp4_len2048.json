It\u2019s a great book that helps you understand the importance of having a clear vision and a plan to achieve it. The book is divided into four sections: Vision, People, Data, and Issues. In this post, I will focus on the first section, Vision.\n\n## What is Vision?\n\nVision is the long-term goal or desired outcome of your business. It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation. It helps you stay", "\n\nI'm trying to create a rust app that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using the elevenlabs.io api. I've been able to create a basic app that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using the `tts` crate, but I'm having trouble integrating the elevenlabs.io api into the app.\n\nHere's what I have so far:\n\n```\nuse tts::Tts;\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().sync().unwrap();\n    let tts = Tts::new().unwrap();\n    tts.say(text).unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to integrate the elevenlabs.io api into this app. Can someone help me with that?\n\nHere's the relevant part of the elevenlabs.io api documentation:\n\n```\nPOST /v1/text-to-speech/{voice_id}\n\nRequest body:\n{\n  \"text\": \"Hello, world!\"\n}\n\nResponse:\n{\n  \"audio\": \"data:audio/wav;base64,UklGRigAAABXQVZFZm10IBAAAAABAAEARKwAAIhYAQQzAAA=\",\n  \"status\": \"success\"\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to make a POST request to the api with the text from the clipboard and then use the response to play the audio.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the updated code with the `reqwest` and `tokio` crates:\n\n```\nuse tts::Tts;\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\nuse tokio;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().sync().unwrap();\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text\n        }))\n        .send()\n        .await\n        .unwrap();\n    let audio = response.json::<serde_json::Value>().await.unwrap()[\"audio\"].as_str().unwrap();\n    let tts = Tts::new().unwrap();\n    tts.say(audio).unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nI'm still having trouble with the audio not playing. I think it might be because the audio is in base64 format, but I'm not sure how to decode it. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the updated code with the `base64` crate:\n\n```\nuse tts::Tts;\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\nuse tokio;\nuse base64;\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() {\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().sync().unwrap();\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text\n        }))\n        .send()\n        .await\n        .unwrap();\n    let audio = response.json::<serde_json::Value>().await.unwrap()[\"audio\"].as_str().unwrap();\n    let decoded_audio = base64::decode(audio).unwrap();\n    let tts = Tts::new().unwrap();\n    tts.say(decoded_audio).unwrap();\n}\n```\n\nI'm still having trouble with the audio not playing. I think it might be because the `tts` crate doesn't support playing audio from a byte array. Any help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the updated", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == \"column\":\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == \"row\":\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == \"custom\":\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\nCan someone explain it to me?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it. A pull is a feature that is pulled by the user, because they have asked for it.", "", " How to create a react app and node and express js web app for creating or add dummy data and show and How I can deploy the code after create build.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. The VSS and VDD pins of the LCD should be connected to the GND and 5V pins of the Arduino, respectively. The V0 pin (for contrast) should be connected to a 10K Ohm potentiometer, which in turn is connected to 5V and GND. The RS, EN, and D4-D7 pins of the LCD should be connected to digital pins on the Arduino [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n2. **Software Setup:**\n   - Install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library by Frank de Brabander in the Arduino IDE. Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries, search for \"LiquidCrystal I2C\", and install it [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n3. **Arduino Code:**\n   - Here's a sample Arduino code to read temperature from the LM35 sensor and display it on the LCD using the potentiometer for contrast control:\n\n```cpp", " The most quoted verse in the Bible is John 3:16, which says, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\"", " I have a list of objects and I want to sort them by a property in case sensitive way.

This type of trading is particularly beneficial for refiners due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Cash Flow**: Asset backed trading allows refiners to unlock the value of their assets, such as inventory, equipment, or even future production, to secure immediate cash. This can significantly improve their cash flow, especially during periods of tight liquidity.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: By using assets as collateral, refiners can mitigate the risk of default by their counterparties. If the counterparty fails to meet their obligations, the refiner can seize the asset to recover their funds.\n\n3. **Access to Financing**: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with access to financing options that might not be available through traditional lending channels. This can be particularly useful for smaller refiners or those operating in challenging market conditions.\n\n4. **Hedging Against Price Volatility**: By pre-selling their production or inventory, refiners can hedge against price volatility in the crude oil and petroleum product markets. This can help stabilize their revenues and protect against sharp price drops.\n\n5. **Enhanced Creditworthiness", " If you need more information ask for it.\n\nBased on the provided data, the current pH level is 8.0, which is above the maximum accepted value of 7.5.

I'm trying to figure out how to make people understand the importance of taking it daily. I'm not sure how to approach this. Any suggestions?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI think you need to make it clear that the product is a supplement, not a medicine. People are used to taking medicine when they are sick, not when they are healthy. So you need to make it clear that this is a product that is meant to be taken when you are healthy, to keep you healthy.\n\nYou also need to make it clear what the benefits of the product are. What does it do for you? How does it make your life better? Why should you take it every day?\n\nYou might also want to consider offering a subscription service, where people can sign up to receive a regular supply of the product. This can make it easier for people to remember to take it every day, and it can also make it easier for them to see the long-term benefits of the product.\n\nFinally, you might want to consider offering some kind of incentive for people to take the product every day. This could be a discount on the product, or some other kind of reward. This can help to motivate people to take the product every day, even if they don't see the immediate benefits.", "", " We have a template file which contains placeholders and user can provide the format of the code.

You can use `DataFrame` to join two `DataFrame`s and then use `groupBy` to group by `query` and `timestamp` and then use `count` to count the number of hits and misses.
