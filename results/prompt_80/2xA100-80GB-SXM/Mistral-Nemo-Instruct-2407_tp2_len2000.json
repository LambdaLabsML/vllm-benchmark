I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2.

I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and then use the `reqwest` crate to send a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to do this.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure how to proceed from here. I'm not sure how to handle the response from the elevenlabs.io api and play the audio. I'm also not sure if I'm using the `reqwest` crate correctly.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. You'll need to use a 10K Ohm potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD. One end of the potentiometer should be connected to VCC, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD. The other pins of the LCD should be connected as follows: RS to digital pin 12, EN to digital pin 11, D4 to digital pin 5, D5 to digital pin 4, D6 to digital pin 3, and D7 to digital pin 2 [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the potentiometer to the Arduino.

Here's a step-by-step process of a product designer:\n\n1. **Empathize and Research:**\n   - Understand the user: their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. This can be done through user interviews, surveys, and observations.\n   - Research the market, competition, and industry trends to identify opportunities and gaps.\n   - Gather and analyze data to inform your design decisions.\n\n2. **Define the Problem:**\n   - Based on your research, clearly define the problem you're trying to solve. This should be user-centered and address a genuine need or pain point.\n   - Create a problem statement that guides your design process.\n\n3. **Ideate:**\n   - Brainstorm a wide range of creative ideas and solutions.

This type of trading is particularly beneficial for refiners due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Cash Flow**: Asset backed trading allows refiners to unlock the value of their assets, such as inventory, equipment, or even future production, to secure immediate cash. This can significantly improve their cash flow, especially during periods of tight liquidity.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: By using assets as collateral, refiners can mitigate the risk of default by their counterparties. If the counterparty fails to meet their obligations, the refiner can seize the asset to recover their funds.\n\n3. **Access to Financing**: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with access to financing options that might not be available through traditional lending channels. This can be particularly useful for smaller refiners or those operating in challenging market conditions.\n\n4. **Hedging Against Price Volatility**: By pre-selling their production or inventory, refiners can hedge against price volatility in the oil market. This can help stabilize their revenue and protect against sharp price drops.\n\n5. **Enhanced Creditworthiness**: The use of", " If you need more information ask for it.\n\nBased on the provided data, the current pH level is 8.0, which is above the maximum accepted value of 7.5.
