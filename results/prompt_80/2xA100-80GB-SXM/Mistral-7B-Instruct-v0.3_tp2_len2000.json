Install Rust:\n   Follow the instructions on the official Rust website to install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install\n\n2. Create a new Rust project:\n   Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new Rust project:\n\n   ```\n   cargo new elevenlabs_tts --bin\n   ```\n\n3. Add dependencies:\n   In the `Cargo.toml` file, add the following dependencies:\n\n   ```toml\n   [dependencies]\n   reqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n   serde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\n   serde_json = \"1.0\"\n   clipboard = \"3.0\"\n   tokio = { version = \"1.17\", features = [\"full\"] }\n   ```\n\n4. Implement the main function:\n   Create a new file named `src/main.rs` and add the following code:\n\n   ```rust\n   use reqwest::Client;\n   use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n   use clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n   use std::env;\n   use tokio::task::spawn_blocking;\n\n   #[tokio::main]\n   async fn main() {\n       let api_key = env::var(\"ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY\").expect(\"API key not found\");\n       let clipboard = ClipboardProvider::new().unwrap();\n       let text = clipboard.get_contents().unwrap();\n\n       let response = spawn_blocking(move || {\n           let client = Client::new();\n           let url = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/synthesize\";\n           let data = serde_json::json!({\n               \"text\": text,\n               \"voice\": \"en-US-Wavenet-A\",\n               \"ssml\": false\n           });\n\n           let req = client.post(url)\n               .header(\"Authorization\", format!(\"Bearer {}\", api_key))\n               .json(&data)\n               .send()\n               .expect(\"Failed to send request\");\n\n           let response = req.json::<Response>().expect(\"Failed to parse response\");\n\n           response.audio\n       })\n       .await\n       .expect(\"Failed to run blocking task\");\n\n       // Save the audio data to a file\n       let mut file = std::fs::File::create(\"output.mp3\").expect(\"Failed to create file\");\n       file.write_all(&response).expect(\"Failed to write audio data\");\n\n       // Play the audio file using a media player\n       // (This step is platform-specific and requires additional libraries)\n   }\n\n   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, Debug)]\n   struct Response {\n       audio: Vec<u8>,\n       // Other fields...\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Set the API key as an environment variable:\n   Replace `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` in the code with your actual API key from Eleven Labs. You can set the API key as an environment variable in your terminal:\n\n   ```\n   export ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY=your_api_key\n   ```\n\n6. Run the application:\n   In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   cargo run\n   ```\n\nNow, when you run the application, it will read the contents of the clipboard aloud using the Eleven Labs API and save the audio to a file named `output.mp3`. To play the audio file, you can use a media player or implement audio playback functionality in your Rust application.", " and understand.\n\n---\n\n# Second Draft\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the design and implementation of a new filter system for our application. The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to filter data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. The filter system should allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria.\n2. The filter system should support both basic and advanced filtering options.\n3. The filter system should provide a clear and user-friendly interface for setting filters.\n4. The filter system should support real-time filtering, meaning that changes to filters should be reflected immediately in the displayed data.\n5. The filter system should be customizable, allowing administrators to add, remove, or modify filters as needed.\n\n## Design\n\n### Basic Filters\n\nBasic filters will be represented by simple text fields and dropdown menus. Users will be able to select a filter type (e.g., equal to, greater than, less than) and enter a value. Multiple basic filters can be combined using logical operators (AND, OR).\n\n### Advanced Filters\n\nAdvanced filters will allow users to create more complex filtering conditions using logical expressions. For example, a user could create a filter that", "\n\nIn the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is actively seeking a solution to a problem or need. This is in contrast to a \"pull,\" where a customer is not actively seeking a solution but is influenced or motivated to take action by an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a recommendation from a friend.\n\nIn other words, a push is a proactive approach to solving a customer's job, while a pull is a reactive approach. The JTBD framework emphasizes understanding the underlying jobs that customers are trying to get done, and then designing products or services that effectively solve those jobs for them. By understanding the customer's job and the context in which it is being done, companies can create solutions that are more likely to be successful and meet the customer's needs.", "", "\n\nTo create a React and Node.js/Express web application for creating or adding dummy data and displaying it, follow the steps below:\n\n1.

This guide will focus on using the DS18B20 temperature sensor and LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library for LCD control.\n\n1. Gather the necessary components:\n   - Arduino board\n   - DS18B20 temperature sensor\n   - LCD display (16x2 or larger)\n   - 4-pin LCD module (backlight, VSS, VDD, SDA, SCL)\n   - 10K Ohm potentiometer\n   - Jumper wires\n\n2. Install the LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library:\n   - Open the Arduino IDE.\n   - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries.\n   - Search \"LiquidCrystal I2C\", then find the LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library by Frank de Brabander.\n   - Click Install button to install the library.\n\n3. Connect the components as follows:\n   - Connect the DS18B20 sensor to the Arduino board as per the wiring diagram provided in [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd)].\n   - Connect the LCD display to the Arduino board as per the LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library documentation. The backlight pin should be connected to a PWM-enabled pin (e.g., pin 9 or 10) for controlling the brightness using the potentiometer.\n   - Connect the potentiometer between the VCC and the backlight pin of the LCD module. The other end of the potentiometer should be connected to GND.\n\n4. Write the code to read temperature from the DS18B20 sensor, control the LCD display, and adjust the backlight brightness using the potentiometer. You can find a sample code in [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd)].\n\n5.

By default, it uses a string comparison algorithm that is case-sensitive.\n\nIf you want to perform case-insensitive sorting, you can create a custom compare function that converts both strings to the same case (usually lowercase) before comparing them. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = ['Apple', 'apples', 'banana', 'Banana'];\n\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(array); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'banana', 'apples']\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase, and then the `localeCompare()` method to compare them. The `localeCompare()` method is a more sophisticated string comparison function that takes into account the user's locale settings.\n\nIf you don't need to consider the user's locale, you can also use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert both strings to uppercase before comparing them:\n\n```javascript\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toUpperCase().localeCompare(b.toUpperCase()));\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result as the previous example, but with all strings in uppercase.", "\n\nThe error message you're seeing is because the `using enum` feature is a C++20 feature, and your compiler is not set to support C++20.\n\nTo use `using enum`, you need to enable C++20 in your project settings.

Identifying a Need: The first step in the product design process is identifying a need or problem that the product will address. This can be done through market research, customer feedback, or by observing trends in the industry.\n\n2. Research and Analysis: Once a need has been identified, the product designer will conduct research to understand the target market, competition, and technology available. This may involve studying user behavior, conducting surveys, and analyzing market data.\n\n3. Concept Development: Based on the research, the product designer will develop one or more concepts for the product. This may involve sketching, prototyping, and brainstorming sessions.\n\n4. Prototyping: The product designer will create a prototype of the product to test its feasibility and usability. This prototype may be a physical model, a digital model, or a detailed description of the product.\n\n5. Testing and Iteration: The prototype is then tested with potential users to gather feedback. Based on this feedback, the product designer will make necessary adjustments and improvements to the design. This process of testing and iteration may be repeated several times until the product meets the desired specifications.\n\n6. Production: Once the product design is finalized, the product designer will work with manufacturers to produce the product on a larger scale.

The `match()` function is then used to find the first match in the string. If a match is found, it is stored in the `match` variable, and we can access the matched string by using `match[0]`.", "\n\nOnce you have compiled the C# file into a DLL, you can", "\n\nHere's an example of the `SettingsController`'s `edit` action:\n```ruby\ndef edit\n  @weekly_allowance = Allow", "?\n\nThe vaccines work by stimulating the immune system to produce an immune response to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This is done by introducing a piece of the virus (or a piece of its genetic material) into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies can then recognize and fight off the virus if the person is exposed to it in the future.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccines is determined through clinical trials, which are large studies conducted on a representative sample of people to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new drug or vaccine. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the trials involved thousands of participants who were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo (a harmless substance). The participants were then followed for several months to see how many people in each group developed COVID-19.\n\nThe results of the clinical trials showed that the vaccines were highly effective at preventing COVID-19, with efficacy rates of 95% or higher for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and 70-75% for the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines. These results were based on the number of cases of COVID-19 that occurred in the trial participants during the study period.\n\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of the vaccines may vary depending on factors such as the age and health status of", "?\n\nPolyfills are a way to provide modern browser functionality to older browsers that do not support it natively. They are typically small pieces of code that you can include in your project to make sure that your code works consistently across different browsers.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the `Array.from()` method, but you know that some older browsers do not support it, you can use a polyfill to make sure that it works in those browsers as well.\n\nPolyfills can be written in JavaScript, and they can be included in your project using a script tag or a module system like CommonJS or ES6 modules. Some popular polyfill libraries include `core-js` and `es6-shim`.\n\nIt's important to note that polyfills should be used judiciously, as they can add extra weight to your project and potentially cause compatibility issues if not used correctly. It's always a good idea to test your code in multiple browsers to make sure that it works as expected.\n\nHere's", "\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a group of dragon riders who have built a fortified base on a mountain made of dragon steel, the strongest material in the known world. They have a hangar full of dragon armor and weapons, and their outpost is called Oshira. However, they are under constant threat from an army of dragon hunters who are trying to raid the outpost and capture the dragons for their own purposes.\n\nTristian is the leader of the Oshiran Riders, and he is accompanied by his friends Brandon, David, Amber, Minna, Jonathan, and Sarah. Amber and Minna are in a relationship with Tristian, and their dragons are an orange and blue color, and white and violet color, respectively. Tristian's own dragon, Wildfire, is an emerald green and black. Brandon's dragon is an orange and darker orange color, David's dragon is white and light blue, and Sarah's witch has a lightning blue and black dragon.\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a tough and skilled group, and they are able to resist the dragon hunters' attacks. However, they know that they cannot hold out forever, and they must find a way to defeat the dragon hunters and protect their home. They are determined to fight for their freedom and the freedom of their dragons.\n\nOne day, the dragon hunters launch a massive attack on Oshira. The Oshiran Riders are outnumbered, but they fight bravely. Tristian leads the charge, with Wildfire breathing fire and destroying the enemy's weapons and armor. Amber and Minna use their dragons to create a wall of fire, while David and Sarah use their dragons to attack from the air.\n\nThe battle is fierce, and it seems like the Oshiran Riders may be defeated. But just when all hope seems lost, a group of dragons that have been enslaved by the dragon hunters break free and join the fight on the side of the Oshiran Riders. With the help of these new allies, the Oshiran Riders are able to turn the tide of the battle and defeat the dragon hunters.\n\nThe Oshiran Riders celebrate their victory, and they are hailed as heroes. They have saved their home and their dragons, and they are determined to continue fighting for freedom and justice. They know that there will always be those who seek to enslave and exploit dragons, but they are ready to stand up and fight for what is right.\n\nThe End.", "\n\nAsset-backed trading (ABT) is a financial instrument that allows refiners to monetize their physical assets, such as crude oil or petroleum products, by selling them to a counterparty and simultaneously entering into a swap agreement to buy them back at a later date. This allows refiners to free up capital, reduce financing costs, and manage price risk.\n\nHere are some specific benefits that a refiner can gain from asset-backed trading:\n\n1. Improved liquidity: By monetizing their physical assets, refiners can free up capital that can be used for other purposes, such as investing in new projects, paying down debt, or improving working capital.\n2. Reduced financing costs: ABT can help refiners reduce their financing costs by providing an alternative source of funding that is often cheaper than traditional bank loans. This is because the counterparty providing the funding is typically a financial institution that specializes in trading and has a lower cost of capital.\n3. Price risk management: ABT can help refiners manage price risk by allowing them to lock in the price of their physical assets at the time of the trade. This can help them avoid the volatility of the commodity markets and ensure that they receive a predictable cash flow.\n4.
