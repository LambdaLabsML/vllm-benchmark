It's the pain, frustration, or dissatisfaction that motivates them to look for a better alternative. A push can be a problem, a constraint, or a limitation that makes the customer feel like they need to change.\n\nExample: A customer is frustrated with their current phone's battery life, which is always running out of charge at the worst times. This frustration is a push that motivates them to look for a new phone with better battery life.\n\n**Pull**: A pull, on the other hand, is the attractive force that draws a customer towards a new solution", "\n\n\n\n**Project Charter Template**\n\n**Project Title:** [Insert project title]\n\n**Project Sponsor:** [Insert project sponsor's name]\n\n**Project Manager:** [Insert project manager's name]\n\n**Date:** [Insert date]\n\n**Project Overview:**\n\nThe purpose of this project is to [insert brief project description].

The LM35 temperature sensor is a popular choice for this project, and it can be connected to the Arduino board via VCC and GND pins [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)]. The analog output pin of the LM35 temperature sensor is connected to the analog input pin A0 of Arduino.\n\nNext, you need to connect the LCD screen to the Arduino board. The LCD screen can be connected to the Arduino board using an I2C interface, and you need to install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library in the Arduino IDE to control the LCD screen [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\nTo control the brightness of the LCD screen, you can use a 10 K Ohm potentiometer. The potentiometer is connected to the LCD screen and the Arduino board, and it controls the brightness of the LCD screen by adjusting the voltage supplied to the LCD screen [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n\nOnce the hardware connections are made, you can write the code to read the temperature from the temperature sensor and display it on the LCD screen.

By default, JavaScript's sort() method is case-insensitive. How can I achieve case-sensitive sorting in JavaScript?\nYou can use the `localeCompare()` method to achieve case-sensitive sorting in JavaScript. Here is an example:\n```javascript\nconst arr = ['Zebra', 'apple', 'Banana', 'cat', 'Dog'];\n\narr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, undefined, { sensitivity: 'case' }));\n\nconsole.log(arr); // Output: ['apple', 'Banana', 'cat', 'Dog', 'Zebra']\n```\nIn this example, the `localeCompare()` method is used as the compare function for the `sort()` method. The `sensitivity` option is set to `'case'` to enable case-sensitive sorting.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `charCodeAt()` method to compare the ASCII values of the characters:\n```javascript\nconst arr = ['Zebra', 'apple', 'Banana', 'cat', 'Dog'];\n\narr.sort((a, b) => {\n  for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(a.length, b.length); i++) {\n    if (a.charCodeAt(i) !== b.charCodeAt(i)) {\n      return a.charCodeAt(i) - b.charCodeAt(i);\n    }\n  }\n  return a.length - b.length;\n});\n\nconsole", "swift\nextension AppDelegate: GIDSignInDelegate", " \n\nThe book is correct in that the syntax is correct for c++20, but the compiler is not set to use c++20 by default. \n\nTo fix this, you need to tell the compiler to use c++20. \n\nIn visual studio, you can do this by going to project properties -> c/c++ -> language -> c++ language standard and selecting ISO C++20 (std:c++20) \n\nAlternatively, you can add the following line to your code: \n\n#pragma once\n#define _HAS_CXX20 1\n\nHowever, the latter method is not recommended as it can lead to unexpected behaviour if the compiler does not support c++20 features. \n\nThe correct way to do this is to set the compiler to use c++20 in the project settings. \n\nThe \"using enum\" syntax is a c++20 feature, and", "\nThe process of a product designer typically involves several stages, from research and concept development to prototyping and testing.

Embeddings are a fundamental technique used to represent complex data in a dense and meaningful way, enabling efficient processing and analysis.\nWhat are embeddings?\nEmbeddings are a way to represent complex data, such as text or images, as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space. These vectors, also known as embeddings, capture the essential features and relationships of the original data, allowing for efficient processing and analysis.\nIn NLP, embeddings are used to represent words, phrases, or documents as vectors in a high-dimensional space", " \n\nHere are some more detailed steps for installing AR technology on specific", " \n\nYou can use the `JSONB` type in TypeORM to store JSON data in a PostgreSQL database.\n\nHere is an example of how you can define a column with the `JSONB` type in a TypeORM entity:\n```\nimport { Entity, Column } from 'typeorm';\n\n@Entity()\nexport class MyEntity {\n  @Column('jsonb')\n  data: any;\n}\n```\nIn this example, the `data` column is defined as a `JSONB` type, which allows you to store JSON data in the column.\n\nNote that you can also use the `JSON` type instead of `JSONB`, but `JSONB` is generally recommended because it provides additional features such as indexing and querying support.\n\nAlso, you can use `@Column('jsonb', { nullable: true })` if you want to allow null values in the column.\n\nYou can also use `@Column('jsonb', { default: '{}' })` to set a default value for the column.\n\nYou can also use `@Column('jsonb', { transformer: { from: (value) =>", "?\n\nFor example, if the string is \"abc123def456\", the regex should return \"123\".\n\n## Step 1: Define the problem and the desired outcome\nWe need to create a JavaScript regex that finds the first set of numbers in a given string. The desired outcome is to extract the first sequence of digits from the string.\n\n## Step 2: Identify the pattern to match\nThe pattern we want to match is one or more digits (0-9) that appear together. This can be represented by the regex pattern `\\d+`.\n\n## Step 3: Use the regex pattern to find the first match\nTo find the first match, we can use the `match()` method in JavaScript, which returns an array containing the matched text if it finds a match. Since we want the first match, we don't need to use the `g` flag (global match) in our regex pattern.\n\n## Step 4", "", "", "?\nThe COVID vaccines have been tested in clinical trials, which are research studies that involve people. These trials are designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the vaccines. Here's a simplified overview of how the trials work and how we can determine that the COVID vaccines are effective:\n**Clinical Trial Design:**\n\n1. **Randomization**: Participants are randomly assigned to either receive the vaccine (treatment group) or a placebo (control group). This helps to minimize bias and ensures that the groups are similar in terms of demographics, health status, and other factors.\n2. **Blinding**: The participants, researchers, and outcome assessors are often blinded to the group assignments, which means they don't know who received the vaccine or the placebo. This helps to reduce bias and ensures that the results are not influenced by expectations or preconceptions.\n3. **Follow-up**: Participants are followed for a period of time (e.g., several months) to monitor their health and record any adverse events or COVID-19 cases.\n\n**Measuring Vaccine Effectiveness:**\n\n1. **Primary Endpoint**: The primary endpoint is the main outcome measure used to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness. For COVID-19 vaccines, the primary endpoint is often the incidence of severe COVID-19, hospitalization, or death due to COVID-19.\n2. **Vaccine Efficacy**: Vaccine efficacy", "?\nPolyfills are pieces of code (or plugins) that provide the technology that you, the developer, expect the browser to provide natively. Polyfills allow older browsers to run newer JavaScript features by providing fallback functionality.\nIn other words, polyfills are a way to make sure that your code works in older browsers that don't support the latest JavaScript features.\nFor example, if you want to use the `Array.prototype.includes()` method in your code, but you need to support Internet Explorer 11, which doesn't support it, you can use a polyfill to add that functionality to the `Array.prototype` in IE11.\nPolyfills can be used to support a wide range of features, including:\nNew JavaScript methods and functions (e.g. `Array.prototype.includes()`, `String.prototype.startsWith()`)\nNew syntax features (e.g. arrow functions, classes)\nNew APIs (e.g. `fetch()`, `Promise`)\nNew DOM features (e.g. `Element.prototype.closest()`, `", " They are a group of dragon riders that are trying to protect their home and dragons from the dragon hunters.

Here are some ways a refiner can benefit from asset backed trading: 1. **Improved cash flow**: By using their assets as collateral, a refiner can access financing and improve their cash flow, which can be used to fund their operations, pay suppliers, or invest in new projects. 2. **Reduced financing costs**: Asset backed trading can provide a refiner with access to lower-cost financing, as the lender is secured by the value of the assets. This can help reduce the refiner's financing costs and improve their profitability. 3. **Increased trading volumes**: With asset backed trading, a refiner can increase their trading volumes, as they can use their assets to secure financing and take on more trades. This can help them to increase their revenue and market share. 4. **Better risk management**: Asset backed trading can help a refiner to manage their risk more effectively, as the value of their assets can be used to offset potential losses.
