I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` and `reqwest` crates to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\nreqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n```\n\n3. I've tried to use the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and then use the `reqwest` crate to send a request to the elevenlabs.io api, but I'm not sure how to do this.\n\nHere's my current code:\n\n```rust\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\nuse reqwest::Client;\n\nfn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {\n    let client = Client::new();\n    let text = ClipboardProvider::new().get_contents()?;\n    let response = client\n        .post(\"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\")\n        .header(\"xi-api-key\", \"YOUR_API_KEY\")\n        .json(&json!({\n            \"text\": text,\n            \"voice_settings\": {\n                \"stability\": 0.5,\n                \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n            }\n        }))\n        .send()?;\n\n    let status = response.status();\n    println!(\"Status: {}\", status);\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nI'm not sure if this is the right approach, or if there's a better way to do this. I'm also not sure how to handle the response from the elevenlabs.io api and play the audio.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated!\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation for reference: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/docs/text-to-speech>", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == \"column\":\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == \"row\":\n            filtered_data = filtered_data.iloc[filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == \"custom\":\n            filtered_data = execute_query(filter", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding what a push and a pull are in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. You'll need to use a 10K Ohm potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD. One end of the potentiometer should be connected to VCC, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD. The other pins of the LCD should be connected as follows: RS to digital pin 12, EN to digital pin 11, D4 to digital pin 5, D5 to digital pin 4, D6 to digital pin 3, and D7 to digital pin 2 [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the potentiometer to the Arduino. One end to GND, the other end to 5V, and the middle pin to analog pin A1.\n\n2. **Software Setup:**\n   - Install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library by Frank de Brabander.

This type of trading is often used in the oil and gas industry, where the asset can be a refinery, a pipeline, or a storage facility.\n\nFor a refiner, asset backed trading can provide several benefits:\n\n1. Improved Cash Flow: By using the refinery as collateral, the refiner can secure financing without having to provide cash upfront. This can help improve cash flow, especially during periods of low refining margins.\n\n2. Access to Capital: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with access to capital that they might not otherwise have. This can be used to fund expansion projects, upgrade facilities, or invest in new technologies.\n\n3. Risk Mitigation: By using the refinery as collateral, the refiner can mitigate some of the risks associated with trading. If the refiner defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the refinery to recoup their investment.\n\n4. Increased Flexibility: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with increased flexibility in their operations. For example, they may be able to secure financing to run the refinery at higher rates during periods of strong demand", " If you need more information ask for it.\n\nBased on the provided data, the current pH level is 8.0, which is above the maximum accepted value of 7.5.
