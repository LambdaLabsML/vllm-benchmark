It's a fantastic book that helps entrepreneurs and business leaders create a clear plan for their company. The book is based on the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), which is a simple, yet powerful framework for building a successful business.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Traction is the idea of a \"rock.\" A rock is a specific, measurable goal that you want to achieve in a specific timeframe. Rocks are used to focus the company on what's most important and to create a sense of urgency around achieving those goals.\n\nIn this episode, I'm going to share my own experience with using rocks", "\n\nHere is a simple example of how you can create a Rust application that uses the ElevenLabs API to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using TTS:\n\nFirst, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:\n```\n[dependencies]\nelevenlabs-api = \"0.1.0\"\ntts = \"0.3.0\"\n```\nThen, create a new Rust file (e.g. `main.rs`) and add the following code:\n```\nuse elevenlabs_api::ElevenLabs;\nuse tts::TTS;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Initialize the ElevenLabs API\n    let api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\";\n    let api_secret = \"YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE\";\n    let eleven_labs = ElevenLabs::new(api_key, api_secret);\n\n    // Initialize the TTS engine\n    let tts = TTS::new();\n\n    // Get the contents of the clipboard\n    let clipboard_contents = std::env::var(\"clipboard_contents\").unwrap();\n\n    // Use the ElevenLabs API to read the contents of the clipboard aloud\n    let response = eleven_labs.read_text(clipboard_contents);\n\n    // Convert the response to a string\n    let response_str = response.text().unwrap();\n\n    // Use the TTS engine to read the response aloud\n    tts.speak(response_str).unwrap();\n}\n```\nReplace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE` with your actual ElevenLabs API key and secret.\n\nThis code uses the `elevenlabs-api` crate to interact with the ElevenLabs API, and the `tts` crate to read the response aloud. It gets the contents of the clipboard using the `std::env::var` function, and then uses the ElevenLabs API to read the contents aloud. Finally, it uses the TTS engine to read the response aloud.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to install the `tts` crate and its dependencies using `cargo build` and `cargo run` commands.\n\nAlso, you can use `clipboard` crate to get the clipboard contents, it's a cross-platform crate that allows you to read and write the clipboard contents.\n```\nuse clipboard::Clipboard;\n\nfn main() {\n    let clipboard = Clipboard::new();\n    let contents = clipboard.get_text().unwrap();\n    // ...\n}\n```\nYou can add the `clipboard` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file like this:\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.4.0\"\n```\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.", ". Also, you need to add more details about the filters, like what they do, and how they work.\nHere is the new version:\n\n**Second Draft**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the design and implementation of a new feature for the [Application Name]. The feature is designed to provide a more efficient and user-friendly way to filter and sort data.\n\n**Filters**\n\nThe filters are a crucial part of the feature, allowing users to narrow down the data to specific criteria. There are three types of filters:\n\n### 1. **Category Filter**\n\nThe Category Filter allows users to filter data by category. This filter is useful for users who want to view data related to a specific category, such as \"Sales\" or \"Marketing\".\n\n* **How it works:** The Category Filter uses a dropdown menu to display a list of categories. Users can select a category from the list, and the data will be filtered to show only the data related to that category.\n* **Example:** If a user selects the \"Sales\" category, the data will be filtered to show only the sales-related data.\n\n### 2. **Date Filter**\n\nThe Date Filter allows users", "?\nIn the JTBD (Job To Be Done) context, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is motivated to take an action because they are being pushed or driven by an internal or external force.\nIn other words, a push is when a customer is compelled to take a specific action because of a need, desire, or obligation that is driving them to do so. This can be due to various factors such as:\nA need or want that is not being met\nA problem or pain point that needs to be solved\nA desire to achieve a specific goal or outcome\nA sense of obligation or responsibility\nA push can be triggered by various stimuli, such as:\nA customer's internal motivations, such as a desire to improve their health or achieve a personal goal\nExternal factors, such as a salesperson's pitch or a friend's recommendation\nA customer's environment, such as a change in their work or personal circumstances\nIn the context of", "  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ", " \n\nHere is the step by step guide:\n\nStep 1: Create a new React App\n\nOpen your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:\n```\nnpx create-react-app my-app\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `my-app` with the basic structure for a React app.\n\nStep 2: Create a new Node and Express.js Server\n\nCreate a new file called `server.js` in the root of your project directory:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello from Express!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3001, () => {\n  console.log('Server started on port 3001');\n});\n```\nThis code sets up a basic Express.js server that listens on port 3001 and responds to GET requests to the root URL with a simple message.\n\nStep 3: Create a RESTful API\n\nCreate a new file called `api.js` in the root of your project directory:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {\n  const data = [\n    { id: 1, name: 'John', age: 30 },\n    { id: 2, name: 'Jane', age: 25 },\n    { id: 3, name: 'Bob', age: 40 },\n  ];\n  res.json(data);\n});\n\napp.listen(3001, () => {\n  console.log('API server started on port 3001');\n});\n```\nThis code sets up a RESTful API that listens on port 3001 and responds to GET requests to the `/api/data` endpoint with a JSON array of dummy data.\n\nStep 4: Connect the React App to the Node and Express.js Server\n\nIn your React app, create a new file called `api.js` in the `src` directory:\n```\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nconst api = axios.create({\n  baseURL: 'http://localhost:3001/api',\n});\n\nexport default api;\n```\nThis code sets up an Axios instance that points to the Node and Express.js server.\n\nStep 5: Use the API in Your React App\n\nIn your React app, create a new component called `DataList.js` in the `src` directory:\n```\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport api from './api';\n\nconst DataList = () => {\n  const [data, setData] = useState([]);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    api.get('/data')\n      .then(response => {\n        setData(response.data);\n      })\n      .catch(error => {\n        console.error(error);\n      });\n  }, []);\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {data.map(item => (\n        <li key={item.id}>{item.name} ({item.age})</li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default DataList;\n```\nThis code sets up a React component that fetches the dummy data from the Node and Express.js server using the Axios instance.\n\nStep 6: Deploy the Code\n\nTo deploy the code, you can use a service like Vercel or Netlify. Here's an example of how to deploy the code to Vercel:\n\n1. Create a new Vercel project and select the \"Create a new project\" option.\n2. Choose the \"React\" template and select the \"Create project\" button.\n3. In the \"Project settings\" page, select the \"Build & deploy\" tab and choose the \"Build\" option.\n", " You may need to adjust the scheduling interval,", " The end.", "\n\n\n\n**Assistant**\n\n\n\n**", "\n\nWhat is the meaning of \"test\"?\nWhat are the synonyms of \"test\"?\nWhat is the definition of \"test\" in the context of a series of questions or exercises?", " [duplicate]\n\nThis question already has an answer here:\n\n  - Maven pom.xml template for a simple Java project 2 answers\n\nHere is a basic Maven POM template for a Java project:\n```\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\"\n     xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n     xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 \n     http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n\n  <groupId>com.example</groupId>\n  <artifactId>my-java-project</artifactId>\n  <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n  <packaging>jar</packaging>\n\n  <name>My Java Project</name>\n  <description>This is a sample Java project.</description>\n\n  <properties>\n    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>\n    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>\n  </properties>\n\n  <dependencies>\n    <!-- Add your dependencies here -->\n  </dependencies>\n\n  <build>\n    <plugins>\n      <plugin>\n        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n        <version>3.8.1</version>\n        <configuration>\n          <source>1.8</source>\n          <target>1.8</target>\n        </configuration>\n      </plugin>\n    </plugins>\n  </build>\n</project>\n```\nThis POM file specifies the basic information about your project, such as its group ID, artifact ID, version, and packaging.

The temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature, and the potentiometer is used to control the brightness of the LCD display. The query is related to Arduino, as the provided search results suggest.\n\nTo create an LCD control system using a potentiometer and temperature sensor, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Install the necessary libraries: The LiquidCrystal I2C library is required to communicate with the LCD display. This library can be installed using the Arduino IDE [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n2. Connect the components: The temperature sensor (LM35) should be connected to the analog input pin A0 of the Arduino board. The potentiometer should be connected to the analog input pin A1 of the Arduino board. The LCD display should be connected to the digital pins of the Arduino board.\n3. Write the code: The code should include the necessary libraries and functions to read the temperature from the LM35 sensor, read the potentiometer value, and display the temperature and brightness on the LCD display. The code can be written using the Arduino IDE.\n4. Upload the code: The code should be uploaded to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.\n5. Test the system: The system should be tested by connecting the temperature sensor to a hot and cold source, and adjusting the potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD display.\n\nThe following code can be used as a starting point:\n```c\n#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>\n\nconst int lcdRS = 12;\nconst int lcdEN = 11;\nconst int lcdD4 = 5;\nconst int lcdD5 = 4;\nconst int lcdD6 = 3;\nconst int lcdD7 = 2;\n\nconst int tempPin = A0", " According to a survey conducted by the American Bible Society, the most quoted biblical verse is John 3:16, which reads, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes", "?\nYou can use the `localeCompare()` method to sort strings in a case-sensitive manner. This method compares two strings and returns a value indicating their relative order. The value is a negative number if the first string is less than the second, zero if they are equal, and a positive number if the first string is greater than the second.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nconst arr = ['hello', 'Hello', 'HELLO', 'goodbye'];\n\narr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));\n\nconsole.log(arr); // Output: [\"Hello\", \"HELLO\", \"hello\", \"goodbye\"]\n```\nIn this example, the `localeCompare()` method is used to compare each pair of strings in the array. The comparison is case-sensitive, so the strings are sorted in a case-sensitive manner.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `toLowerCase()` or `toUpperCase()` method to convert all strings to a consistent case (e.g. lowercase or uppercase) before sorting. This can be useful if you want to sort strings in a case-insensitive manner.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nconst arr = ['hello', 'Hello', 'HELLO', 'goodbye'];\n\narr.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(arr); // Output: [\"goodbye\", \"hello\", \"Hello\", \"HELLO\"]\n```\nIn this example, the `toLowerCase()` method is", "swift\n@available(iOS 9.0", " \n\nThe book I am following is \"Effective Modern C++\" by Scott Meyers and it says that this is a new feature in C++20. \n\nI am using Visual Studio 2019 which is supposed to support C++20. \n\nWhat am I missing? \n\nPlease help. \n\nThank you. \n\nHere is the enum definition:\n\nenum class Operation {\n add,\n subtract,\n multiply,\n divide\n};\n\nI have also tried to use the following code:\n\ndouble calculate(Operation op, double num1, double num2) {\n enum class Operation {\n  add,\n  subtract,\n  multiply,\n  divide\n };\n switch (op) {\n case add:\n return num1 + num2;\n case subtract:\n return num1 - num2;\n case multiply:\n return num1 * num2;\n case divide:\n return num1 / num2;\n }\n}\n\nBut it", "\nProduct designers are responsible for creating and improving the design of products, from concept to production. Here's an overview of the process:\n1. Research and Analysis:\nProduct designers start by researching the market, competitors, and customer needs to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement. They analyze the product's functionality, user experience, and aesthetics to identify areas for improvement.\n2. Concept Development:\nBased on the research and analysis, product designers develop concepts for the product. They create sketches, prototypes, and computer-aided designs (CAD) to visualize the product's design and functionality.\n3. Design Development:\nThe product designer refines the design concept, considering factors such as usability, ergonomics, and aesthetics. They create detailed designs, including specifications, materials, and manufacturing processes.\n4. Prototyping:\nProduct designers create prototypes to test and refine the design. Prototypes can be physical, digital, or a combination of both. They test the prototype with users to gather feedback and identify areas for improvement.\n5. Testing and Iteration:\nProduct designers test the prototype with users, gathering feedback and identifying areas for improvement. They iterate on the design, making changes and refinements based on user feedback and testing results.\n6. Production Design:\nOnce the design is finalized, product designers create production-ready designs, including specifications, materials, and manufacturing processes.

The phrase \"derivative riveting shimmering river nymphs\" is likely a humorous or sarcastic description of the art of the Renaissance, particularly the depiction of mythological figures such as river nymphs. The phrase is probably meant to convey that the art of the Renaissance was overly focused on classical themes and motifs, and that the depictions of these figures were often overly ornate and lacking in originality.\n\nIn other words, the phrase is suggesting that the art of the Renaissance was \"derivative\"", " \n\nAcknowledged.", "\nHere is a random", " and identification\nMicrobial classification and identification are crucial steps in understanding the diversity of microorganisms and their roles in various ecosystems.

The `input_file` parameter specifies the path to the input CSV file, the `output_file` parameter specifies the path to the output CSV file, and the `parse_rules` parameter is a list of dictionaries that specify the parse rules to apply to each row of the input file.\n\nThe `parse_rules` list contains dictionaries with two keys: `column_index` and `regex`. The `column_index` key specifies the index of the column to extract data from, and the `regex` key specifies the regular expression to use to extract the data.\n\nThe `parse_csv` function opens the input file and creates a CSV reader object, then iterates through the rows in the input file. For each row, it applies the parse rules specified in the `parse_rules` list and extracts the desired data. The extracted data is then written to the output file using a CSV writer object.\n\nIn the example code, the `parse_rules_list` variable defines a list of parse rules to apply to the input file. The first rule extracts the first column of the input file and applies a regular expression to extract a sequence of digits. The second rule extracts the second column of the input file and applies a regular expression to extract a date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. The third rule extracts the first column of the input file and applies a regular expression to extract a sequence of digits.\n\nThe `parse_csv` function is then called with the input file, output file, and parse rules list as arguments. The function extracts the data from the input file according to the parse rules and writes it to the output file.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input file has a header row, and that the column indices specified in the parse rules are zero-based (i.e., the first column is column 0). You may need to modify the code to accommodate different file formats or column indexing schemes. Additionally, you may want to add error handling to handle cases where the input file is malformed or the parse rules are invalid.", ": A Survey\nEmbedding is a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

I have an entity that has a field that should store JSON data. What type should I use for this field in the entity?\n\nAccording to the TypeORM documentation, you can use the `Json` type for this purpose.

It is compatible with PostgreSQL's `json` data type.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `Jsonb` type, which is similar to `Json` but is more efficient for storing and querying JSON data:\n```\nimport { Entity, Column } from 'typeorm';\nimport { Jsonb } from 'typeorm/json';\n\n@Entity()\nexport class MyEntity {\n  @Column('jsonb')\n  myJsonbField: Jsonb;\n}\n```\nThe `Jsonb` type is also compatible with", "?\n\nFor example, if the string is \"hello123world456\", the regex should return \"123\".\n\nHere is a simple regex that should work:\n\n```javascript\nvar str = \"hello123world456\";\nvar regex = /^\\d+/;\nvar match = str.match(regex);\nconsole.log(match[0]); // Outputs: \"123\"\n```\n\nThis regex `^\\d+` matches one or more digits (`\\d+`) at the start of the string (`^`). The `^` character is an anchor that means \"start of the string\", and the `\\d+` matches one or more digits. The `+` is a quantifier that means \"one or more of the preceding element\".\n\nIf you want to match the first set of numbers in the string, regardless of its position, you can use the following regex:\n\n```javascript\nvar str = \"hello123world456\";\nvar regex = /\\d+/;\n", " For example:\n```\ncsc.exe /target:library /out:My", " Here's an example implementation:\n```ruby\nclass SettingsController < ApplicationController\n  def edit\n    @weekly_allowance = current_user.weekly_allowance\n  end\n\n", "?\nDetermining the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines involves several steps and multiple criteria. Here are some of the key methods used to evaluate their performance:\n1. Phase III clinical trials: Before a vaccine is approved for use, it undergoes rigorous testing in large-scale clinical trials, known as Phase III trials. These trials involve thousands of participants who receive either the vaccine or a placebo. Researchers track the number of participants who develop COVID-19, severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The results are compared between the vaccine and placebo groups to determine the vaccine's effectiveness.\n2. Efficacy: Efficacy is the percentage of participants who develop COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine compared to those who receive the placebo. A vaccine with high efficacy is more effective at preventing the disease.\n3. Vaccine effectiveness: Vaccine effectiveness is the percentage of participants who develop COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine, taking into account factors such as age, health status, and exposure to the virus. This measure helps researchers understand how well the vaccine works in real-world settings.\n4. Real-world data: After a vaccine is approved, researchers collect data on its performance in real-world settings, such as healthcare systems, schools, and communities. This data helps identify any potential issues or concerns and provides insights into the vaccine's effectiveness in different populations.\n5.

Here are some strategies that can help:\n\n1. **Emphasize the benefits**: Highlight the benefits of taking the daily dosage, such as improved health, increased energy, or better overall well-being. Use testimonials, case studies, or scientific research to support your claims.\n2. **Create a routine**: Encourage consumers to make taking the daily dosage a part of their daily routine, such as taking it with breakfast or before bedtime. This can help make it a habit.\n3. **Make it convenient**: Make it easy for consumers to take their daily dosage by providing a convenient packaging or a reminder system.\n4. **Educate and inform**: Educate consumers about the importance of taking the daily dosage and how it can help them achieve their health goals. Provide clear instructions and guidelines on how to take the product.\n5. **Use persuasive language**: Use persuasive language in your marketing materials, such as \"essential for optimal health\" or \"a must-have for a healthy lifestyle.\"\n6. **Offer incentives**: Offer incentives, such as discounts or free shipping, to encourage consumers to take their daily dosage consistently.\n7. **Monitor progress**: Encourage consumers to track their progress and monitor their health metrics, such as blood pressure or cholesterol levels, to see the benefits of taking the daily dosage.\n8. **Partner with", " I'll do my best to help you with it.\n\nAlso, please note that I'll need your permission to extract the ZIP file", " \n\nHere is the problem statement:\n\nGiven a set of templates and a set of user-defined rules, generate code in the user's format.\n\nTemplates: These are the basic structure of the code that we want to generate. For example, a template for a Java class might look like this:\n```\npublic class ${CLASS_NAME} {\n    private ${ATTRIBUTE1} ${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME};\n    private ${ATTRIBUTE2} ${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME};\n\n    public ${CLASS_NAME}() {\n        // constructor\n    }\n\n    public void set${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME}(${ATTRIBUTE1} ${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME}) {\n        this.${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME} = ${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME};\n    }\n\n    public ${ATTRIBUTE1} get${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME}() {\n        return this.${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME};\n    }\n\n    public void set${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME}(${ATTRIBUTE2} ${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME}) {\n        this.${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME} = ${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME};\n    }\n\n    public ${ATTRIBUTE2} get${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME}() {\n        return this.${ATTRIBUTE2_NAME};\n    }\n}\n```\nUser-defined rules: These are the rules that the user wants to apply to the generated code. For example, the user might want to add a specific comment at the top of the file, or change the naming convention for the attributes.\n\nAlgorithm:\n\n1. Read the templates and user-defined rules.\n2. Identify the placeholders in the templates (e.g. `${CLASS_NAME}`, `${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME}`, etc.).\n3. Replace the placeholders with the actual values from the user-defined rules.\n4. Generate the code by filling in the placeholders with the actual values.\n5. Return the generated code.\n\nHere is a more detailed algorithm:\n\n1. Read the templates and user-defined rules:\n\t* Read the templates from a file or database.\n\t* Read the user-defined rules from a file or database.\n2. Identify the placeholders in the templates:\n\t* Use a regular expression to identify the placeholders in the templates (e.g. `${CLASS_NAME}`, `${ATTRIBUTE1_NAME", ".\n\n \n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor Notes:\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\nService Advisor: Taylor Waldbauer\n\n", " The app also allows users to share their avatar with friends and family.\n\nHere are the technologies involved in the process:\n\n**Computer Vision**\n\n* Object Detection\n* Pose Estimation\n* 3D Reconstruction\n* Face Recognition\n* Hairstyle Recognition\n\n**Machine Learning**\n\n* Deep Learning\n* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)\n* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)\n* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\n\n**3D Modeling**\n\n* 3D Avatar Creation\n* 3D Clothes Modeling\n* 3D Pose Estimation\n\n**E-commerce**\n\n* Fashion Recommendation\n* Product Suggestion\n* User Profiling\n\n**Social Media**\n\n* Social Sharing\n* User Engagement\n\n**Other**\n\n* Video Processing\n", "\nMe and sonic go to the arcade together\nMe and sonic go to the arcade together\nMe and sonic go to the arcade together\nMe and sonic go to the arcade together\nMe and sonic go to", " |\n| Business Analyst | Senior Business Analyst | AWS, Azure, GCP | Administrator | FullAccess or ReadOnly access to cloud", " [1]\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Mahindra and Mahindra.
