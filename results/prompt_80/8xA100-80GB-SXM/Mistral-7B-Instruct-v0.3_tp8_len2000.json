Install Rust:\n   Follow the instructions on the official Rust website to install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install\n\n2. Create a new Rust project:\n   Open a terminal and run the following command to create a new Rust project:\n\n   ```\n   cargo new elevenlabs_tts --bin\n   ```\n\n3. Add dependencies:\n   In the `Cargo.toml` file, add the following dependencies:\n\n   ```toml\n   [dependencies]\n   reqwest = { version = \"0.11\", features = [\"json\"] }\n   serde = { version = \"1.0\", features = [\"derive\"] }\n   serde_json = \"1.0\"\n   clipboard = \"3.0\"\n   tokio = { version = \"1.17\", features = [\"full\"] }\n   ```\n\n4. Implement the main function:\n   Create a new file named `src/main.rs` and add the following code:\n\n   ```rust\n   use reqwest::Client;\n   use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};\n   use clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n   use std::env;\n   use tokio::task::spawn_blocking;\n\n   #[tokio::main]\n   async fn main() {\n       let api_key = env::var(\"ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY\").expect(\"API key not found\");\n       let clipboard = ClipboardProvider::new().unwrap();\n       let text = clipboard.get_contents().unwrap();\n\n       let response = read_text_to_speech(&api_key, &text).await;\n       if let Ok(response) = response {\n           println!(\"Response: {:?}\", response);\n       }\n   }\n\n   async fn read_text_to_speech(api_key: &str, text: &str) -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {\n       let client = Client::new();\n       let url = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/tts\";\n       let body = serde_json::json!({\n           \"text\": text,\n           \"voice\": \"en-US-Wavenet-A\",\n           \"format\": \"mp3\"\n       });\n       let response = client\n           .post(url)\n           .header(\"Authorization\", format!(\"Bearer {}\", api_key))\n           .json(&body)\n           .send()\n           .await?;\n       let response_text = response.text().await?;\n       Ok(response_text)\n   }\n\n   #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]\n   struct TtsResponse {\n       url: String,\n   }\n   ```\n\n5. Set the API key:\n   Set the `ELEVEN_LABS_API_KEY` environment variable with your Eleven Labs API key.\n\n6. Run the application:\n   In the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:\n\n   ```\n   cargo run\n   ```\n\nNow, when you run the application, it will read the contents of the clipboard aloud using the Eleven Labs API. Make sure you have the required Eleven Labs API key and the necessary Rust dependencies installed.", " and understand.\n\n---\n\n# Second Draft\n\n## Introduction\n\nThis document outlines the design and implementation of a new filter system for our application. The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to filter data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. The filter system should allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria.\n2. The filter system should provide a clear and user-friendly interface for applying filters.\n3. The filter system should support complex filtering logic, such as AND, OR, and NOT operations.\n4. The filter system should be able to handle large datasets efficiently.\n5. The filter system should be customizable, allowing developers to add new filters as needed.\n\n## Design\n\n### Data Model\n\nThe data model will consist of a `Filter` class and a `Filterable` interface.

This is in contrast to a \"pull,\" where a customer is not actively seeking a solution, but is triggered or motivated to take action by an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a recommendation from a friend.\n\nIn other words, a push is when the customer is the one initiating the search for a solution, while a pull is when the solution is being pushed towards the customer. Understanding the difference between push and pull can help businesses better understand their customers' needs and motivations, and develop more effective marketing and sales strategies.", "", "\n\nTo create a React and Node.js/Express web application for creating or adding dummy data and displaying it, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1.

This guide will focus on using an Arduino board, LM35 temperature sensor, and LCD display.\n\n1. Gather the necessary components:\n   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)\n   - LM35 temperature sensor\n   - LCD display (16x2 or similar)\n   - 10 K Ohm potentiometer\n   - Jumper wires\n   - Breadboard (optional)\n\n2.

By default, it uses a string comparison algorithm that is case-sensitive.\n\nIf you want to perform case-insensitive sorting, you can create a custom compare function that converts both strings to the same case (usually lowercase) before comparing them. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = ['Apple', 'apples', 'banana', 'Banana'];\n\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(array); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'banana', 'apples']\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase, and then the `localeCompare()` method to compare them. The `localeCompare()` method is a more sophisticated string comparison function that takes into account the user's locale settings.\n\nIf you don't need to consider the user's locale, you can also use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert both strings to uppercase before comparing them:\n\n```javascript\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toUpperCase().localeCompare(b.toUpperCase()));\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result as the previous example, but with all strings in uppercase.", "\n\nThe error message you're seeing is because the `using enum` feature is a C++20 feature, and your compiler is not set to support C++20.\n\nTo use `using enum`, you need to enable C++20 in your compiler settings.

However, the `jsonb` type does not support JSON functions like `->>` and `->`.\n\nYou can choose the type that best fits your use case. If you need to query the JSON data frequently and want to use indexes, use `jsonb`.

The `match()` function is then used to find the first match in the string.

This is done by introducing a piece of the virus (or a piece of its genetic material) into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies can then recognize and neutralize the virus if it enters the body in the future, preventing infection or reducing the severity of symptoms if infection does occur.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccines is determined through clinical trials, which involve testing the vaccine on a large group of people to see how well it works and whether it has any serious side effects. The trials are designed to include a diverse group of people, including those who are at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19, such as older adults and people with certain underlying health conditions.\n\nThe results of the clinical trials are then reviewed by regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective enough to be approved for use. Once a vaccine is approved, it is continuously monitored for safety and effectiveness through ongoing surveillance and post-marketing studies.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of the vaccines can vary depending on factors such as the specific vaccine being used, the age and health status of the individual receiving the vaccine, and the prevalence of the virus in the community.

They are typically small pieces of code that you can include in your project to make sure that your code works consistently across different browsers.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the `Array.from()` method, but you know that some older browsers do not support it, you can use a polyfill to make sure that it works in those browsers as well.\n\nPolyfills can be written in JavaScript, and they can be included in your project using a script tag or a module system like CommonJS or ES6 modules. Some popular polyfill libraries include `core-js` and `es6-shim`.\n\nIt's important to note that polyfills should be used judiciously, as they can add extra code to your project and potentially slow down performance. It's always a good idea to test your code in multiple browsers to see if it works without a polyfill before adding one.\n\nHere's", "\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a group of dragon riders who have built a fortified base on a mountain made of dragon steel, the strongest material in the known world. They have a hangar full of dragon armor and weapons, and their outpost is called Oshira. However, they are under constant threat from an army of dragon hunters who are trying to raid the outpost and capture the dragons for their own purposes.\n\nTristian is the leader of the Oshiran Riders, and he is accompanied by his friends Brandon, David, Amber, Minna, Jonathan, and Sarah. Amber and Minna are in a relationship with Tristian, and their dragons are an orange and blue color, and white and violet color, respectively. Tristian's own dragon, Wildfire, is an emerald green and black. Brandon's dragon is an orange and darker orange color, David's dragon is white and light blue, and Sarah's witch has a lightning blue and black dragon.\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a tough and skilled group, and they are able to resist the dragon hunters' attacks. However, they know that they cannot hold out forever, and they must find a way to defeat the dragon hunters and protect their home. They are determined to fight for their freedom and the freedom of their dragons.\n\nOne day, the dragon hunters launch a massive attack on Oshira. The Oshiran Riders are outnumbered, but they fight bravely and manage to hold the line. However, just when it seems that all hope is lost, a group of dragons that have been enslaved by the dragon hunters break free and join the battle on the side of the Oshiran Riders.\n\nWith the help of these new allies, the Oshiran Riders are able to turn the tide of the battle and defeat the dragon hunters. They celebrate their victory, but they know that their fight is not over. They must continue to protect their home and their dragons from any who would seek to harm them.\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a group of brave and determined dragon riders who will stop at nothing to protect their home and their dragons. They are a symbol of hope and freedom in a world where both are in short supply. They will continue to fight for what they believe in, and they will never give up.", "\n\nAsset-backed trading (ABT) is a financial instrument that allows refiners to monetize their physical assets, such as crude oil or petroleum products, by selling them to a counterparty and simultaneously entering into a swap agreement to buy them back at a later date. This allows refiners to free up capital, reduce financing costs, and manage price risk.\n\nHere are some specific benefits that refiners can derive from ABT:\n\n1. Improved liquidity: ABT can help refiners improve their liquidity by freeing up capital that would otherwise be tied up in physical assets. This can be particularly useful during periods of financial stress, when refiners may need to access cash quickly to meet their obligations.\n2. Reduced financing costs: ABT can help refiners reduce their financing costs by allowing them to borrow against their physical assets at lower interest rates than they would otherwise be able to obtain. This is because the counterparty in the ABT transaction is typically a financial institution that is better able to access capital markets.\n3. Risk management: ABT can help refiners manage price risk by allowing them to lock in the price of their physical assets at the time of the ABT transaction. This can help refiners hedge against price volatility and protect their marg", "\n\nRecomendaci\u00f3n: Debido a que el \u00faltimo valor de pH medido es de 8.0, se recomienda realizar una limpieza del sistema de desalaci\u00f3n para asegurar que el pH del agua de salida est\u00e9 dentro del rango aceptable (6.5 - 7.5).
