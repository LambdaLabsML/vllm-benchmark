The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. You'll need to use a 10K Ohm potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD. One end of the potentiometer should be connected to VCC, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD. The other pins of the LCD should be connected as follows: RS to digital pin 12, EN to digital pin 11, D4 to digital pin 5, D5 to digital pin 4, D6 to digital pin 3, and D7 to digital pin 2 [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the potentiometer to the Arduino.

Here's a step-by-step process of a product designer:\n\n1. **Empathize and Research:**\n   - Understand the user: their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. This can be done through user interviews, surveys, and observations.\n   - Research the market, competition, and industry trends to identify opportunities and gaps.\n   - Gather and analyze data to inform your design decisions.\n\n2. **Define the Problem:**\n   - Based on your research, clearly define the problem you're trying to solve. This should be user-centered and address a genuine need or pain point.\n   - Create a problem statement that guides your design process.\n\n3. **Ideate:**\n   - Brainstorm a wide range of creative ideas and solutions. Encourage wild ideas and quantity over quality at this stage.\n   - Sketch, draw, or use other visual tools to explore and develop your ideas.\n   - Consider different design approaches, such as biomimicry, lateral thinking, or design thinking.\n\n4. **Prototype:**\n   - Create a tangible representation of your design. The fidelity of the prototype depends on the stage of the design process. Early prototypes can be low-fidelity (e.g., sketches, foam models) while later prototypes can", "\n\nI'm looking to generate Apache Airflow configuration code for supporting Azure Active Directory SSO tokens.

This type of trading is particularly beneficial for refiners due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Cash Flow**: Asset backed trading allows refiners to unlock the value of their assets, such as inventory, equipment, or even future production, to secure immediate cash. This can significantly improve their cash flow, especially during periods of tight liquidity.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: By using assets as collateral, refiners can mitigate the risk of default by their counterparties. If the counterparty fails to meet their obligations, the refiner can seize the asset to recover their funds.\n\n3. **Access to Financing**: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with access to financing options that might not be available through traditional lending channels. This can be particularly useful for smaller refiners or those operating in challenging market conditions.\n\n4. **Hedging Against Price Volatility**: By pre-selling their production or inventory, refiners can hedge against price volatility in the oil market.

I'm trying to figure out how to make people understand the importance of taking it daily. I'm not sure how to approach this. Any suggestions?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI think you need to make it clear that the product is a supplement, not a medicine. People are used to taking medicine when they are sick, not when they are healthy. So you need to make it clear that this is a product that is meant to be taken when you are healthy, to keep you healthy.\n\nYou also need to make it clear what the benefits of taking the product are. If it's a multivitamin, for example, you could say that it helps to fill in any gaps in your diet. If it's a probiotic, you could say that it helps to maintain a healthy gut.\n\nYou could also try to make it a habit by making it part of a daily routine. For example, you could take it with breakfast or before bed. You could also try to make it fun by making it a game or a challenge.\n\nFinally, you could try to make it social by making it something that you do with friends or family. For example, you could have a \"supplement party\" where everyone takes their supplements together.\n\nComment: Thanks for your answer. I think you are right. I will try to make it clear that it is a supplement and not a medicine.

The other captains were not as easily swayed as Hook had predicted, and some even refused to join their cause.

For each record in onsite attributed data, if the query is present in top frequent queries dataset and if it's first time the system would count this as a cache miss, send a request to retrieve such query and cache in the memory for 12 hours.

Here is a sample code:\n\n```\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.SparkSession;\nimport org.apache.spark.sql.functions.*;\n\npublic class CacheHitRate {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        SparkSession spark = SparkSession.builder()\n                .appName(\"CacheHitRate\")\n                .master(\"local[*]\")\n                .getOrCreate();\n\n        // Load your data\n        Dataset<Row> onsiteAttributedData = spark.read().parquet(\"path/to/your/data\");\n        Dataset<Row> topFrequentQueries = spark.read().parquet(\"path/to/your/topFrequentQueries\");\n\n        // Join onsiteAttributedData with topFrequentQueries on query field\n        Dataset<Row> joinedData = onsiteAttributedData.join(topFrequentQueries, onsiteAttributedData.col(\"query\").equalTo(topFrequentQueries.col(\"query\")));\n\n        // Add a new column to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss\n        Dataset<Row> withCacheHit = joinedData.withColumn(\"cacheHit\", when(col(\"query\").isin(joinedData.select(\"query\").distinct().collectAsList()), true).otherwise(false));\n\n        // Calculate the hit rate\n        Dataset<Row> hitRate = withCacheHit.groupBy(\"cacheHit\").agg(count(\"*\").as(\"count\"), countDistinct(\"query\").as(\"distinctQueries\"));\n        hitRate.show();\n\n        spark.stop();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis code will join your `onsiteAttributedData` with `topFrequentQueries` on the `query` field. Then it adds a new column `cacheHit` to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss. Finally, it calculates the hit rate by grouping by `cacheHit` and aggregating the count of records and the count of distinct queries.\n\nComment: Thanks for your help. I have a question, how can I add a new column to indicate whether it's a cache hit or miss?
