The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to filter data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. The filter system should allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria.\n2. The filter system should provide a clear and user-friendly interface for applying filters.\n3. The filter system should support complex filtering logic, such as AND, OR, and NOT operations.\n4. The filter system should be able to handle large datasets efficiently.\n5. The filter system should be customizable, allowing developers to add new filters as needed.\n\n## Design\n\n### Data Model\n\nThe data model will consist of a `Filter` class and a `Filterable` interface. The `Filter` class will represent a single filter, while the `Filterable` interface will be implemented by any class that can be filtered.\n\n```java\npublic interface Filterable {\n    void applyFilter(Filter filter);\n}\n```\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Filter {\n    protected Filterable data;\n\n    public Filter(Filterable data) {\n        this", "\n\nIn the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is actively seeking a solution to a problem or need. This is in contrast to a \"pull,\" where a customer is not actively seeking a solution but is influenced or motivated to take action by an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a recommendation from a friend.\n\nIn other words, a push is a proactive approach to solving a customer's job, while a pull is a reactive approach. Understanding the difference between push and pull can help businesses develop more effective strategies for identifying and meeting customer needs.", "", "\n\nTo create a React and Node.js/Express web application for creating or adding dummy data and displaying it, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1.

This guide will focus on using an Arduino board, LM35 temperature sensor, and LiquidCrystal I2C library for LCD display.\n\n1. Gather the necessary components:\n   - Arduino board\n   - LM35 temperature sensor\n   - LCD display (16x2 or similar)\n   - 10 K Ohm potentiometer\n   - Jumper wires\n\n2. Install the LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library:\n   - Open the Arduino IDE.\n   - Go to Tools > Manage Libraries.\n   - Search \"LiquidCrystal I2C\", then find the LiquidCrystal\\_I2C library by Frank de Brabander.\n   - Click Install button to install the library. [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)]\n\n3. Connect the components:\n   - Connect the LM35 temperature sensor to the Arduino board as follows:\n     - VCC (power) to 5V pin on Arduino.\n     - GND (ground) to GND pin on Arduino.\n     - Analog output pin to analog input pin A0 on Arduino.\n   - Connect the LCD display to the Arduino board as per the LCD's datasheet.\n   - Connect the 10 K Ohm potentiometer to the Arduino board as follows:\n     - One end to +VCC (5V pin on Arduino).\n     - Middle pin to pin 3 of the LCD (for controlling the backlight brightness).\n     - Other end to GND pin on Arduino.\n\n4.

By default, it uses a string comparison algorithm that is case-sensitive.\n\nIf you want to perform case-insensitive sorting, you can create a custom compare function that converts both strings to the same case (usually lowercase) before comparing them. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = ['Apple', 'apples', 'banana', 'Banana'];\n\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(array); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'banana', 'apples']\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase before comparing them using the `localeCompare()` method. The `localeCompare()` method compares two strings in a locale-sensitive way, which means it takes into account the rules of the user's locale for sorting.\n\nIf you don't need locale-sensitive sorting, you can use the `toUpperCase()` method instead of `toLowerCase()` to convert both strings to uppercase before comparing them.", "\n\nThe error message you're seeing is because the `using enum` feature is a C++20 feature, and your compiler is not set to support C++20.\n\nTo use `using enum`, you need to enable C++20 in your compiler settings.

However, the `jsonb` type does not support JSON functions like `->>` and `->`.\n\nYou can choose the type that best fits your use case.

This is done by introducing a piece of the virus (or a piece of its genetic material) into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies can then recognize and neutralize the virus if it enters the body in the future.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccines is determined through clinical trials, which are large studies conducted on a representative sample of the population. In these trials, a group of people is given the vaccine, while another group is given a placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic effect). The groups are then followed over time to see how many people in each group develop COVID-19. If the vaccine is effective, fewer people in the vaccine group will develop the disease compared to the placebo group.\n\nThe results of these clinical trials are then analyzed to determine the vaccine's efficacy, which is the percentage reduction in the risk of developing COVID-19 that is attributed to the vaccine. For example, if a vaccine is 95% effective, it means that it reduces the risk of developing COVID-19 by 95% compared to not receiving the vaccine.\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of the vaccines can vary depending on factors such as the age and health status of the individuals being vaccinated, the strain of the virus, and the", "?\n\nPolyfills are a way to provide modern browser functionality to older browsers that do not support it natively. They are typically small pieces of code that you can include in your project to make sure that your code works consistently across different browsers.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the `Array.from()` method, but you know that some older browsers do not support it, you can use a polyfill to make sure that it works in those browsers as well.\n\nPolyfills can be written in JavaScript, and they can be included in your project using a script tag or a module system like CommonJS or ES6 modules. Some popular polyfill libraries include `core-js` and `es6-shim`.\n\nIt's important to note that polyfills should be used judiciously, as they can add extra weight to your project and potentially cause compatibility issues if not used correctly. It's always a good idea to test your code in multiple browsers to make sure that it works as expected.\n\nHere's", "\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a group of dragon riders who have built a fortified base on a mountain made of dragon steel, the strongest material in the known world.

Here's how a refiner can benefit from ABT:\n\n1. Risk management: ABT provides a way for refiners to manage price risk by locking in the price of their crude oil inventories. This can help protect against sudden price drops, which can lead to significant financial losses.\n2. Improved cash flow: By locking in the price of their crude oil inventories, refiners can improve their cash flow by knowing exactly how much they will receive for their crude oil when they sell it. This can help them plan for future expenses and investments.\n3. Access to capital: ABT can provide refiners with access to capital by allowing them to sell their crude oil inventories to a financial institution and receive payment upfront. This can help refiners fund their operations and investments.\n4. Flexibility: ABT can provide refiners with greater flexibility in their operations. For example, if a refiner has a large inventory of crude oil and is facing a sudden drop in demand, they can use ABT to sell their inventory and free up storage space.\n5.
