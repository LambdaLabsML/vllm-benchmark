I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3.

The user copies some text to the clipboard.\n2. The user runs the app.\n3. The app reads the contents of the clipboard and sends it to the elevenlabs.io api.\n4. The elevenlabs.io api returns an audio file that the app plays using the system's default audio player.\n5. The user hears the text being read aloud.\n\nI'm not sure how to implement this in rust, but I think it should be possible using the `clipboard` crate to read the contents of the clipboard and the `reqwest` crate to send a request to the elevenlabs.io api. I'm not sure how to play the audio file that the api returns, but I think it should be possible using the `rodio` crate.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\".

The ID can be a single value or a list of values. The filter will return true if the ID of the data matches any of the values in the list.\n* **Filter by Name**: Filters the data based on the name of the data.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. The VSS and VDD pins of the LCD should be connected to the GND and 5V pins of the Arduino, respectively. The RS, EN, and D4-D7 pins of the LCD should be connected to the appropriate digital pins of the Arduino. The potentiometer controls the brightness of the LCD and should be connected as follows: one end to 5V, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n2. **Software Setup:**\n   - Install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library by Frank de Brabander in the Arduino IDE.

Here's a step-by-step process of a product designer:\n\n1. **Empathize and Research:**\n   - Understand the user: their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. This can be done through user interviews, surveys, and observations.\n   - Research the market, competition, and industry trends to identify opportunities and gaps.\n   - Gather and analyze data to inform your design decisions.\n\n2. **Define the Problem:**\n   - Based on your research, clearly define the problem you're trying to solve. This should be user-centered and address a genuine need or pain point.\n   - Create a problem statement that guides your design process.\n\n3. **Ideate:**\n   - Brainstorm a wide range of creative ideas and solutions. Encourage wild ideas and quantity over quality at this stage.\n   - Sketch, draw, or use other low-fidelity methods to quickly explore and communicate your ideas.\n   - Consider using techniques like mind mapping, SCAMPER, or the \"6-3-5\" method to stimulate creative thinking.\n\n4. **Prototype:**\n   - Choose the most promising ideas from your ideation phase and create prototypes.
