For example, if I have an array like this:\nvar arr = ['a', 'A', 'b', 'B', 'c', 'C'];\nI want to sort it like this:\nvar arr = ['A', 'a', 'B', 'b', 'C', 'c'];\nHow can I do this in JavaScript?\nmarked as duplicate by Bergi \u00a0javascript Mar 7 '17 at 15:01\nYou can use the sort function and pass a function that compares the two elements. The function should return a negative number if the first element is less than the second, a positive number if the first element is greater than the second, and zero if they are equal.\nIn your case, you can use the following function:\nfunction compare(a, b) {\n    if (a.toLowerCase() < b.toLowerCase()) {\n    if (a.toLowerCase() > b.toLowerCase()) {\nThen you can use the sort function like this:\nvar arr = ['a', 'A', 'b', 'B', 'c', 'C'];\narr.sort(compare);\nconsole.log(arr); // [\"A\", \"a\", \"B\", \"b\", \"C\", \"c\"]\nYou can also use the built-in String.prototype.localeCompare method, which is more concise:\nfunction compare(a, b) {\n   ", "", " I am using Visual Studio 2019 and I have the latest version of the C++ standard enabled.\n\n\u2022 I think you need to use the namespace name, not the enum name. \u2013\u00a0user253751 Nov 29 '20 at 10:56\n\u2022 @user253751 I tried that but it does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123456789 Nov 29 '20 at 11:00\n\u2022 @user123456789 I think you need to use the namespace name, not the enum name. \u2013\u00a0user253751 Nov 29 '20 at 11:01\n\u2022 @user253751 I tried that but it does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123456789 Nov 29 '20 at 11:02\n\u2022 @user123456789 I think you need to use the namespace name, not the enum name.", "\nThe process of designing a product is a complex one, and it can be difficult to explain to someone who is not familiar with it. However, it is important to understand the process in order to be able to create a successful product.\nThe first step in the process is to identify the need for the product. This can be done by talking to potential customers and finding out what they are looking for. Once the need has been identified, the next step is to come up with a concept for the product. This can be done by brainstorming with a team of designers or by coming up with ideas on your own.\nOnce a concept has been developed, the next step is to create a prototype of the product. This can be done by using a 3D printer or by hand-crafting the prototype. The prototype will be used to test the product and make sure that it meets the needs of the customer.\nOnce the prototype has been tested, the next step is to create a final version of the product. This can be done by using a 3D printer or by hand-crafting the final product. The final product will be used to sell to customers.\nThe process of designing a product is a complex one, but it is important to understand it in order to be able to create a successful product.\n1 What is the process of a product designer?\n2 What", "\n", ""], "errors": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
