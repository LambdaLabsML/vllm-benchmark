In this article, we will break down the process of product design into its key stages, and explain what each stage entails.\nThe first stage of product design is the ideation stage. This is where the designer comes up with ideas for the product. They may do this by brainstorming, or by looking at existing products and seeing how they could be improved.\nOnce the designer has some ideas, they will start to develop them further. This is the concept stage, where the designer will create a rough sketch or prototype of the product. They will then test this prototype to see if it works as intended.\nIf the prototype is successful, the designer will move on to the next stage, which is the design stage. This is where the designer will create a detailed design of the product, including all the features and specifications.\nOnce the design is complete, the designer will move on to the production stage. This is where the product is manufactured, and it is important that the designer works closely with the manufacturer to ensure that the product is made to the highest quality.\nFinally, the designer will move on to the marketing stage. This is where the product is promoted and sold to the public. The designer will need to work with the marketing team to ensure that", "\n", ""], "errors": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""]}
