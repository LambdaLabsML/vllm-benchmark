But I want to use case-sensative sorting. For example, if I have an array like this:\nvar arr = [\"apple\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Banana\"];\nI want to sort it like this:\n[\"Apple\", \"apple\", \"Banana\", \"banana\"]\nHow can I do this in JavaScript?\nmarked as duplicate by Bergi \u00a0javascript Sep 15 '16 at 15:01\nYou can use Array.prototype.sort() and pass a function that compares the elements. The function should return a negative number if the first element is less than the second, a positive number if the first element is greater than the second, and zero if they are equal.\nIn your case, you can use the String.prototype.toLowerCase() method to convert the strings to lowercase before comparing them.\narr.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase());\nYou can use the localeCompare method to compare strings in a case-insensitive way.\nvar arr = [\"apple\", \"Apple\", \"banana\", \"Banana\"];\narr.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a.localeCompare(b);\n// [\"Apple\", \"apple\", \"Banana\", \"banana\"]\nYou can use the localeCompare method to compare strings in a case-insensitive way.\nvar arr = [\"apple\", \"Apple\",", "", " I am using Visual Studio 2019 and I have set the language standard to C++20.\n\n\u2022 I think you need to use the full name of the enum, not just the enum value. \u2013\u00a0user253751 Nov 29 '20 at 22:56\n\u2022 @user253751 I tried that and it still does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123456789 Nov 29 '20 at 23:00\n\u2022 @user123456789 I think you need to use the full name of the enum, not just the enum value. \u2013\u00a0user253751 Nov 29 '20 at 23:01\n\u2022 @user253751 I tried that and it still does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123456789 Nov 29 '20 at 23:02\n\u2022 @user123456789 I think you need to use", "\nThe process of product design is a complex one, and it involves a lot of different steps.
