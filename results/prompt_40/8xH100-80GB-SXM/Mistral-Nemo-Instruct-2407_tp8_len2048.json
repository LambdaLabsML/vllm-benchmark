It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console. However, I'm not sure how to use the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I'm new to rust and I'm not sure how to use the elevenlabs.io api in conjunction with the `clipboard` crate.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction>\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHere's an example of how the final app should work:\n\n1. The user copies some text to the clipboard.\n2. The user runs the app.\n3. The app reads the contents of the clipboard and sends it to the elevenlabs.io api.\n4. The elevenlabs.io api returns an audio file containing the text read aloud.\n5. The app plays the audio file using the system's default audio player.\n\nI'm not sure how to implement steps 3-5 in rust.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom condition. The custom condition will be a string that the user can input. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return the data if it does. The custom condition will be a string that the user can input. The filter will then check if the data matches the custom condition and return the data if it does.\n\nHere is the updated version of the Filters part:\n\nFilters\n------\n\nThe following filters are available to filter the data based on various conditions:\n\n* **Date Range Filter**\n  - Filters data based on a specific date range.\n  - Accepts two parameters: start date and end date.\n  - Example: `date_range: \"2022-01-01\", \"2022-12-31\"`\n\n* **Category Filter**\n  - Filters data based on a specific category.\n  - Accepts one parameter: category name.\n  - Example: `category:", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having trouble understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. You'll need to use a 10K Ohm potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD. One end of the potentiometer should be connected to VCC, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD. The other pins of the LCD should be connected as follows: RS to digital pin 12, EN to digital pin 11, D4 to digital pin 5, D5 to digital pin 4, D6 to digital pin 3, and D7 to digital pin 2 [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the potentiometer to the Arduino.
