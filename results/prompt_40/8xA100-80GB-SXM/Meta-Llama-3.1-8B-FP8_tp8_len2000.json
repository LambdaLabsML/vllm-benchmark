I want to use case-sensative sorting. I have tried the following code but it doesn't work.\nvar items = [\"a\", \"A\", \"b\", \"B\", \"c\", \"C\"];\nitems.sort();\nconsole.log(items);\nI want the output to be [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] but it is [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] . How can I do this?\nmarked as duplicate by Bergi \u00a0javascript Sep 20 '16 at 15:31\nYou can use a custom compare function:\nitems.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase());\nThis will sort the items in a case-insensitive way.\nIf you want to sort in a case-sensitive way, you can use the following:\nitems.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a.localeCompare(b);\nIf you want to sort in a case-insensitive way, but with the lowercase items first, you can use the following:\nitems.sort(function(a, b) {\n    return a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()) || a.localeCompare(b);\nThis will sort the items in a case-insensitive way, but with the lowercase items first.\nIf you want to sort in a case-sensitive way, but with the", "", " I am using Visual Studio 2019 and I have set the language standard to C++20.\n\n\u2022 I think you need to use the namespace name in the using enum statement. \u2013\u00a0user4581301 May 15 at 13:58\n\u2022 @user4581301 I tried that but it still does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123 May 15 at 14:00\n\u2022 I think you need to use the namespace name in the using enum statement. \u2013\u00a0user4581301 May 15 at 14:00\n\u2022 @user4581301 I tried that but it still does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123 May 15 at 14:00\n\u2022 @user123: You need to use the namespace name in the using enum statement. \u2013\u00a0user4581301 May 15 at 14:01\n\n", "\nThe process of designing a product is a complex one, and it can be difficult to explain to someone who is not familiar with it. However, it is important to understand the process in order to be able to create a successful product.\nThe first step in the process is to identify the need for the product. This can be done by talking to potential customers and finding out what they are looking for. Once the need has been identified, the next step is to come up with a concept for the product. This can be done by brainstorming ideas with a team of designers or by doing research on similar products.\nOnce a concept has been developed, the next step is to create a prototype of the product. This can be done by using a 3D printer or by hand-crafting the prototype. The prototype will be used to test the product and make sure that it meets the needs of the customer.\nOnce the prototype has been tested, the next step is to create a final design for the product. This will include all of the details of the product, such as the materials that will be used, the dimensions, and the color scheme. The final design will be used to create the product.\nThe final step in the process is to manufacture the product. This can be done by using a factory or by outsourcing the manufacturing to a third party.
