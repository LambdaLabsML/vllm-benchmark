I want to use case-sensative sorting. I have tried the following code but it doesn't work.\nvar items = [\"a\", \"A\", \"b\", \"B\", \"c\", \"C\"];\nitems.sort();\nconsole.log(items);\nI want the output to be [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] but it is [\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"a\", \"b\", \"c\"] . How can I do this?\nmarked as duplicate by Bergi \u00a0javascript Mar 7 '17 at 15:31\nYou can use a custom compare function:\nitems.sort(function(a, b) {\n  return a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase());\nThis will sort the items in a case-insensitive way.\nIf you want to sort in a case-sensitive way, you can use the following:\nitems.sort(function(a, b) {\n  return a.localeCompare(b);\nIf you want to sort in a case-insensitive way, but with the lowercase items first, you can use the following:\nitems.sort(function(a, b) {\n  return a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()) || a.localeCompare(b);\nThis will sort the items in a case-insensitive way, but with the lowercase items first.\nIf you want to sort in a case-sensitive way, but with the", "", " I am using Visual Studio 2019 and I have set the language standard to C++20.\n\n\u2022 I think you need to use the namespace name in the using enum statement. \u2013\u00a0user4581301 May 15 at 12:58\n\u2022 @user4581301 I tried that but it still does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123 May 15 at 13:00\n\u2022 I think you need to use the namespace name in the using enum statement. \u2013\u00a0user4581301 May 15 at 13:00\n\u2022 @user4581301 I tried that but it still does not work. \u2013\u00a0user123 May 15 at 13:00\n\u2022 @user123: You need to use the namespace name in the using enum statement. \u2013\u00a0user4581301 May 15 at 13:01\n\n", "\nThe process of designing a product is a complex one, and it can be difficult to explain to someone who is not familiar with it. However, it is important to understand the process in order to be able to create a successful product.\nThe first step in the process is to identify the need for the product. This can be done by talking to potential customers and finding out what they are looking for. Once the need has been identified, the next step is to come up with a concept for the product. This can be done by brainstorming ideas with a team of designers or by doing research on similar products.\nOnce a concept has been developed, the next step is to create a prototype. This is a physical model of the product that can be used to test the concept and make sure that it is feasible. The prototype can be made using a variety of materials, such as wood, plastic, or metal.\nOnce the prototype has been created, the next step is to test it. This can be done by giving it to potential customers to use and getting their feedback. The feedback can be used to make changes to the prototype and improve it.\nThe final step in the process is to mass produce the product. This can be done by finding a manufacturer who can produce the product in large quantities. The product can then be sold to customers.\nThe process of designing a product is a", "\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory sso tokens\ngenerate apache airflow configuration code for supporting azure active directory s", "", "\nFTM\nSUSHI\nSOL\nSAND\nMANA\nENJ\nGALA\nSXP\nSOLANA\nSOLANA NFT\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOLANA NFT MARKETPLACE\nSOL", ".", " Thank you for your guidance.\nI am a professional writer with over 5 years of experience in content writing.
