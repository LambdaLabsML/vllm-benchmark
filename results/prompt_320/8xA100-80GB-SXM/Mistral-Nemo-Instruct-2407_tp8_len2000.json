It should be inspiring, challenging, and achievable. A well-defined vision helps you make decisions, set priorities, and align your team around a common purpose.\n\n## Why is Vision Important?\n\nVision is important because it provides direction and motivation.

I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I'm new to rust and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction>\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHere's an example of how the elevenlabs.io api can be used in python:\n\n```\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"xi-api-key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n}\n\ndata = {\n    \"text\": \"Hello, world!\",\n    \"voice_settings\": {\n        \"stability\": 0.5,\n        \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\n\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(response.content)\n```\n\nI want to create a similar app in rust that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply the filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply the filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == \"column\":\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_value] != \"\"]\n        elif filter_name == \"custom\":\n            filtered_data = execute_query(filter_value)\n\n    return filtered_data\n\n# example usage\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n   ", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\nCan someone explain it to me?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it. A pull is a feature that is pulled by the user, because they have asked for it.", "", " How to create a react app and node and express js web app for creating or add dummy data and show and How I can deploy the code after create build.

The VCC and GND pins of the sensor should be connected to the 5V and GND pins of the Arduino, respectively. The output pin (Vout) of the LM35 should be connected to one of the analog input pins (e.g., A0) of the Arduino [[3](https://www.hackatronic.com/arduino-with-temperature-sensor-interfacing-lcd-and-lm35/)].\n   - Connect the LCD to the Arduino. You'll need to use a 10K Ohm potentiometer to control the brightness of the LCD. One end of the potentiometer should be connected to VCC, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD.

This type of trading is particularly beneficial for refiners due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Cash Flow**: Asset backed trading allows refiners to unlock the value of their assets, such as inventory, equipment, or even future production, to secure immediate cash flow. This can be particularly useful in times of tight cash flow, such as when market prices are low or when there are delays in payments from customers.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: By using assets as collateral, refiners can mitigate the risk of default by their counterparties. If the counterparty fails to meet their obligations, the refiner can seize the asset to recover their funds. This can provide a level of security and peace of mind for refiners when engaging in trading activities.\n\n3. **Access to Financing**: Asset backed trading can also provide refiners with access to financing options that might not otherwise be available. By using their assets as collateral, refiners can secure loans or other forms of financing from financial institutions that might be hesitant to provide unsecured financing.\n\n4. **Flexibility in Trading**: Asset", " If you need more information ask for it.\n\nBased on the provided data, the current pH level is 8.0, which is above the maximum accepted value of 7.5.

I'm trying to figure out how to make people understand the importance of taking it daily. I'm not sure how to approach this. Any suggestions?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI think you need to make it clear that the product is a supplement, not a medicine. People are used to taking medicine when they are sick, not when they are healthy. So you need to make it clear that this is a product that is meant to be taken when you are healthy, to keep you healthy.\n\nYou also need to make it clear what the benefits of the product are. What does it do for you? How does it make your life better? Why should you take it every day?\n\nYou might also want to consider making the product easy to take. If it's a pill, make it small and easy to swallow. If it's a liquid, make it taste good. If it's a powder, make it easy to mix into a drink. The easier the product is to take, the more likely people are to take it every day.\n\nFinally, you might want to consider offering some kind of incentive to encourage people to take the product every day. This could be a discount on the product, or a free sample, or some other kind of reward. This can help to motivate people to make a habit of taking the product every day.\n\n## Answer (0)\n\nI think you need to make it clear that the product is a supplement, not a medicine.

Bernays, Propaganda (1928)", " In addition, explain how to create a web application in Azure app services.\n\nAzure App Service is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by Microsoft Azure for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, mobile backends, and APIs. It provides a highly scalable, secure, and reliable environment for hosting web applications. Here's a breakdown of key concepts and their relationships:\n\n1. **Resource Groups**: A resource group is a logical container used to manage and organize Azure resources. It helps in grouping related resources for an Azure solution, making it easier to manage, monitor, and deploy them as a single entity. In the context of Azure App Service, a resource group can contain one or more app services, along with other related resources like databases, storage accounts, etc.\n\n   Relationship with App Service:\n   - An App Service can be part of a resource group.\n   - A resource group can contain multiple App Services.\n   - Resource groups help in managing costs, permissions, and lifecycle management of related resources.\n\n2. **App Service Plans**: An App Service Plan defines a set of compute resources that your app runs on, such as the number of virtual machines (VMs) and their size. It determines the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources allocated to your apps. There are different tiers (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, and Isolated) to choose from based on your app's requirements and budget.\n\n   Relationship with App Service:\n   - An App Service must be associated with an App Service Plan.\n   - An App Service Plan can host multiple App Services.\n   - The App Service Plan defines the resource limits and features available to the App Services it hosts.\n\n3. **Web Applications**: A web application is the actual application that you deploy to Azure App Service. It runs on the compute resources defined by the App Service Plan. You can create and manage web applications using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or Azure SDKs.\n\n   Relationship with App Service and App", "", ".\nIf it is stored from dashboard in 24 time formate it would appear in mobile in 24 rime formate.\nIf", " I'm looking for a list of features that I can use as a starting point.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nHere is a list of features that I think would be useful for a group booking manager for airlines.

Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick slices or sticks. Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch. Drain and pat them dry with a clean kitchen towel. This step is crucial to achieve crispy fried potatoes.\n\n2. **Heat the oil**: In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or a deep fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Use a deep-frying thermometer to monitor the oil temperature.\n\n3. **Fry the potatoes in batches**: Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the skillet, carefully add the potatoes to the hot oil.

What are the best practices for marketing this product?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI think you are looking for a product recommendation engine. There are many ways to build a recommendation engine. Here are some of the most common approaches:\n\n1. Collaborative Filtering: This approach uses the behavior of other users to make recommendations. For example, if user A has the same behavior as user B, then the items that user B liked might be recommended to user A.\n2. Content-based Filtering: This approach uses the content of the items to make recommendations. For example, if a user likes movies with action and adventure, then the system might recommend other movies with action and adventure.\n3. Hybrid Filtering: This approach combines the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches.\n4. Matrix Factorization: This approach uses matrix factorization techniques to make recommendations. For example, the user-item interaction matrix can be factorized into two matrices, one for users and one for items, and the recommendations can be made based on the dot product of the user and item matrices.\n5. Deep Learning: This approach uses deep learning techniques to make recommendations. For example, a neural network can be trained to predict the user's preference for an item based on the user's behavior and", " Therefore, the total amount paid by the guest is \u20ac247.98, and the total amount received by the host is \u20ac215.6", " The town and county are united in their opposition to the project.\n\nHe noted the \"remarkable outpouring of opposition\" to Amazon's proposed data center and claimed that the vast majority of the", " I'm thinking of somewhere in Europe but open to other suggestions.

This process is managed by the operating system's memory manager.\n\nSwapping is used to manage the limited amount of physical memory (RAM) in a computer system. When the RAM is full and more memory is needed, the operating system moves some pages of memory to the secondary storage device to free up space in RAM. This process is called paging out or swapping out. When the operating system needs to access the swapped-out pages again, it moves them back from the secondary storage device to RAM.

Here's a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The class is named `Sample` and it has a single method that returns an instance of `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor`.\n\n2. **Bean Annotation**: The method is annotated with `@Bean(\"encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1\")`, which means that the object returned by this method will be managed by Spring and can be retrieved from the application context using the name \"encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1\".\n\n3. **Primary Annotation**: The method is also annotated with `@Primary`, which means that this bean will be given preference when multiple beans of the same type are available in the application context.\n\n4. **Method Signature**: The method takes two arguments: `AppProtectEncryptor` and `KmsEncryptor`, which are used to create a `LinkedHashMap` of encryptors. The keys in the map are \"appProtect\" and \"hera\", and the values are the respective encryptor instances.\n\n5. **Return Value**: The method returns a new instance of `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor` initialized with the `LinkedHashMap` of encryptors.\n\nIn summary, this code configures a Spring bean for an `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor` that uses two other encryptors: `AppProtectEncryptor` and `KmsEncryptor`.

However, with the increasing number of products and customers, it has become challenging for e-commerce platforms to deliver tailored recommendations that cater to individual preferences. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an AI-driven personalized recommendation system that enhances customer experience and improves business outcomes.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe primary problem that this project seeks to address is the lack of personalized product recommendations in e-commerce platforms, which leads to customer dissatisfaction, increased bounce rates, and lost sales opportunities (Ding et al., 2020). Current recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering or content-based approaches, which may not capture the nuances of individual customer preferences and may result in irrelevant or repetitive recommendations (Adomavicius & Tuzhilin, 2005).\n\n**Project Objectives**\n\nThe main objectives of this project are:\n\n1. To develop an AI-driven personalized recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior, preferences, and historical data.\n2. To improve the accuracy and relevance of product recommendations by incorporating contextual information, such as time, location, and user mood.\n3. To enhance customer experience by providing tailored and engaging product recommendations that cater to individual preferences and needs.\n4. To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics and user feedback.\n5. To provide actionable insights and recommendations for e-commerce businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and improve customer retention.\n\n**Project Scope and Limitations**\n\nThis project will focus on developing and implementing an AI-driven personalized recommendation system for a hypothetical e-commerce platform, with a specific emphasis on fashion and lifestyle products. The project will cover the following phases:\n\n1. Data collection and preprocessing\n2. Feature engineering and selection\n3. Model selection and training\n4. System integration and testing\n5. Performance evaluation and optimization\n6. User feedback collection and analysis\n\nThe project will have the following limitations:\n\n1. The project will be conducted on a hypothetical e-commerce platform, and the results may not be directly applicable to real-world scenarios.\n2. The project will focus on fashion and lifestyle products, and the findings may not be generalizable to other product categories.\n3. The project will rely on historical data and may not account for dynamic changes in customer preferences and market trends.\n\n**Research Methodology**\n\nThis project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem and the solution.\n\n1. **Data", ".

I am looking for feedback on this activity and how I can improve it.\n\n**Portfolio Entry: Design Thinking Course - \"Empathy Mapping\" Activity Enhancement**\n\n**Course:** Design Thinking for Innovation\n\n**Level:** Undergraduate (Junior and Senior)\n\n**Duration:** 15 weeks\n\n**Activity Title:** Empathy Mapping: Deepening User Understanding\n\n**Objective:** To enhance students' ability to empathize with users, identify their needs, and generate insights for problem-solving in the design thinking process.\n\n**Original Activity Description:**\n\nThe original empathy mapping activity involved students creating a 4-quadrant map (Say, Think, Do, Feel) based on user interviews. However, students often struggled to go beyond surface-level insights and struggled to connect their findings to the design thinking process.\n\n**Development:**\n\nTo address these challenges, I developed a new version of the empathy mapping activity, \"Empathy Mapping: Deepening User Understanding,\" which includes the following enhancements:\n\n1. **User Persona Creation:** Before the interview, students create a user persona, including demographics, goals, frustrations, and behaviors. This helps students focus their interviews and gain a deeper understanding of their users.\n\n2. **Interview Guides:** I provided students with structured interview guides, including open-ended questions that encourage users to share stories and experiences. This helps students gather more meaningful data.\n\n3. **Affinity Mapping:** After interviews, students use affinity mapping to group and categorize their findings. This helps students identify patterns and trends, leading to more insightful empathy maps.\n\n4. **How-Might-We (HMW) Questions:** Students conclude their empathy maps by formulating HMW questions, which help them translate their insights into actionable problem statements for the next stage of the design thinking process (Ideation).\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nThe enhanced activity was", "", " I will be very grateful to you.\n\nSure, I'd be happy to help you prepare a presentation on popular sports in China.

I have tried the following code but it is not working.\n\n```\nlet num: number;\nnum = prompt(\"Enter a number\");\nconsole.log(num);\n```\n\nComment: What do you mean by \"not working\"? What happens when you run this code?\n\nComment: It is not taking the input from the user\n\nComment: What is the error message you are getting?\n\nComment: It is not showing any error message. It is just not taking the input from the user\n\nComment: What is the output of `console.log(typeof num)`?\n\nComment: It is showing \"undefined\"\n\nComment: That's because `prompt` is a DOM API and TypeScript is transpiled to JavaScript, which is then run in a Node.js environment. You can't use DOM APIs in Node.js. You can use `readline-sync` to get user input in Node.js.\n\nComment: @jsejcksn I am using vs code and I am running the code in the terminal\n\nComment: @jsejcksn I have installed readline-sync but it is still not working\n\nComment: @jsejcksn I have installed readline-sync but it is still not working\n\nComment: @jsejcksn I have installed readline-sync but it is still not working\n\nComment: @jsejcksn", "", " and what are the key changes in CMMC 2.0?\n\nThe Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) framework is a program initiated by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to enhance cybersecurity within the Defense Industrial Base (DIB). The implementation of CMMC has been underway since November 30, 2020, with a five-year phase-in period [[1](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/About/)]. As of March 2021, the DoD has been conducting an internal review of CMMC's implementation [[1](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/About/)].\n\nCMMC 2.0, an updated version of the CMMC framework, was announced in November 2021. The key changes in CMMC 2.0 include:\n\n1. **Reduced Levels**: CMMC 2.0 simplifies the previous five-level model to three levels: Foundational, Advanced, and Expert [[2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/17/2021-24880/cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-cmmc-20-updates-and-way-forward)].\n\n2. **Self-Assessment**: CMMC 2.0 allows organizations to perform self-assessments for the Foundational level, reducing the need for third-party assessments [[2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/17/2021-24880/cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-cmmc-20-updates-and-way-forward)].\n\n3. **Phased Implementation**: The implementation of CMMC", " when I click on it.

The benzene ring is a six-membered ring with alternating double and single bonds, following the aromaticity rule.\n\n2. **Geometry**:\n   - **Benzene Ring**: The benzene ring is planar, with all the carbon atoms sp2 hybridized, forming bond angles of approximately 120 degrees. The ring is aromatic, meaning it has a delocalized \u03c0 system.\n   - **Carbonyl Group**: The carbonyl group (C=O) is also planar, with the carbon atom sp2 hybridized and the oxygen atom sp hybridized. The bond angle between the carbon and oxygen atoms is approximately 120 degrees.\n   - **Amide Group**: The nitrogen atom (N) in the amide group is sp2 hybridized, forming a planar structure with the adjacent carbon and oxygen atoms. The bond angles around the nitrogen atom are approximately 120 degrees.\n\n3. **Connectivity**: The molecule is connected as follows:\n   - The carbonyl carbon atom is connected to the nitrogen atom (CC(=O)N).\n   - The nitrogen atom is connected to the benzene", "", "\n\nI'm glad to help!
