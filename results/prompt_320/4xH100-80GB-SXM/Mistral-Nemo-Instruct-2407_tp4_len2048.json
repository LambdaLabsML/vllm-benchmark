I've found the elevenlabs.io api which seems to support this, but I'm not sure how to use it in rust. I've also found the `clipboard` crate which can read the contents of the clipboard, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api.\n\nHere's what I've tried so far:\n\n1. I've created a new rust project using `cargo new --bin clipboard_tts`\n2. I've added the `clipboard` crate to my `Cargo.toml` file:\n\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.5.0\"\n```\n\n3. I've added the following code to my `main.rs` file:\n\n```\nuse clipboard::ClipboardProvider;\n\nfn main() {\n    let text = clipboard::get().expect(\"Could not get clipboard contents\");\n    println!(\"{}\", text);\n}\n```\n\nThis code reads the contents of the clipboard and prints it to the console, but I'm not sure how to use it in conjunction with the elevenlabs.io api to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.\n\nCan someone help me with this? I'm new to rust and I'm not sure how to proceed.\n\nHere's the elevenlabs.io api documentation: <https://docs.elevenlabs.io/api/introduction>\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nHere's an example of how the elevenlabs.io api can be used in python:\n\n```\nimport requests\nimport json\n\nurl = \"https://api.elevenlabs.io/v1/text-to-speech/21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\",\n    \"xi-api-key\": \"YOUR_API_KEY\"\n}\n\ndata = {\n    \"text\": \"Hello, world!\",\n    \"voice_settings\": {\n        \"stability\": 0.5,\n        \"similarity_boost\": 0.75\n    }\n}\n\nresponse = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json.dumps(data))\n\nwith open(\"output.mp3\", \"wb\") as f:\n    f.write(response.content)\n```\n\nI want to create a similar app in rust that can read the contents of the clipboard aloud using tts.", " and understand. Also, you need to add a new section called \"Additional Filters\" and add a new filter called \"Custom Filter\". This filter will be a custom filter that can be used to filter the data based on a custom query. The query will be provided by the user in the form of a string. The query will be executed using the `execute_query` function. The function will take the query as an argument and return the filtered data.\n\nHere is the updated code:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef execute_query(query):\n    # execute the query and return the filtered data\n    # this is a placeholder function and should be replaced with the actual implementation\n    return pd.DataFrame()\n\ndef filter_data(data, filters):\n    # apply filters to the data\n    filtered_data = data.copy()\n\n    # apply filters\n    for filter_name, filter_value in filters.items():\n        if filter_name == 'column':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data[filter_name] == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'row':\n            filtered_data = filtered_data[filtered_data.index == filter_value]\n        elif filter_name == 'custom':\n            filtered_data =", " and a pull?\n\nI'm reading the book \"Inspired\" by Marty Cagan and I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between a push and a pull in the context of Jobs to be done.\n\nCan someone explain it to me?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nIn the context of Jobs to be done, a push is a feature that is pushed onto the user, without the user having asked for it.

The VSS and VDD pins of the LCD should be connected to the GND and 5V pins of the Arduino, respectively. The RS, EN, and D4-D7 pins of the LCD should be connected to the appropriate digital pins of the Arduino. The potentiometer controls the brightness of the LCD and should be connected as follows: one end to 5V, the other end to GND, and the middle pin to the Vo pin of the LCD [[1](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-temperature-sensor-lcd), [2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n2. **Software Setup:**\n   - Install the LiquidCrystal_I2C library by Frank de Brabander in the Arduino IDE.

Here's a step-by-step process of a product designer:\n\n1. **Empathize and Research:**\n   - Understand the user: their needs, behaviors, motivations, and pain points. This can be done through user interviews, surveys, and observations.\n   - Research the market, competition, and industry trends to identify opportunities and gaps.\n   - Gather and analyze data to inform your design decisions.\n\n2. **Define the Problem:**\n   - Based on your research, clearly define the problem you're trying to solve. This should be user-centered and address a genuine need or pain point.\n   - Create a problem statement that guides your design process.\n\n3. **Ideate:**\n   - Brainstorm a wide range of creative ideas and solutions. Encourage wild ideas and quantity over quality at this stage.\n   - Sketch, draw, or use other visual tools to explore and develop your ideas.\n   - Consider different design approaches, such as biomimicry, lateral thinking, or design thinking.\n\n4. **Prototype:**\n   - Create a tangible representation of your design. The fidelity of the prototype depends on the stage of the design process. Early prototypes can be low-fidelity (e.g., sketches, cardboard models), while later prototypes can", "\n\nI'm looking to generate Apache Airflow configuration code for supporting Azure Active Directory SSO tokens.

This type of trading is particularly beneficial for refiners due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Improved Cash Flow**: Asset backed trading allows refiners to unlock the value of their assets, such as inventory, equipment, or even future production, to secure immediate cash. This can significantly improve their cash flow, especially during periods of tight liquidity.\n\n2. **Risk Mitigation**: By using assets as collateral, refiners can mitigate the risk of default by their counterparties. If the counterparty fails to meet their obligations, the refiner can seize the asset to recover their funds.\n\n3. **Access to Financing**: Asset backed trading can provide refiners with access to financing options that might not be available through traditional lending channels. This can be particularly useful for smaller refiners or those operating in challenging market conditions.\n\n4. **Hedging Against Price Volatility**: By pre-selling their production or inventory, refiners can hedge against price volatility in the oil market.

I'm trying to figure out how to make people understand the importance of taking it daily. I'm not sure how to approach this. Any suggestions?\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI think you need to make it clear that the product is a supplement, not a medicine. People are used to taking medicine when they are sick, not when they are healthy. So you need to make it clear that this is a product that is meant to be taken when you are healthy, to keep you healthy.\n\nYou also need to make it clear what the benefits of the product are. What does it do for you? How does it make your life better? Why should you take it every day?\n\nYou might also want to consider making the product easy to take. If it's a pill, make it small and easy to swallow. If it's a liquid, make it taste good. If it's a powder, make it easy to mix into a drink. The easier the product is to take, the more likely people are to take it every day.\n\nFinally, you might want to consider offering some kind of incentive to encourage people to take the product every day. This could be a discount on the product, or a free sample, or some other kind of reward. This can help to motivate people to make a habit of taking the product every day.\n\n## Answer (0)\n\nI think you need to make it clear that the product is a supplement, not a medicine.

Bernays, Propaganda (1928)", " In addition, explain how to deploy a web application to Azure app services.\n\nAzure App Service is a fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) offered by Microsoft Azure for building, deploying, and scaling web apps, mobile backends, and APIs. It simplifies the deployment and scaling of your applications, making it easier to manage and maintain your web presence. Here's a breakdown of key concepts and how they relate to each other:\n\n1. **Resource Groups**: A resource group is a logical container used to manage and organize Azure resources. It helps in grouping related resources for an Azure solution, making it easier to manage, monitor, and deploy them as a single entity. In the context of Azure App Service, a resource group can contain one or more app services, along with other related resources like databases, storage accounts, etc.\n\n   - *Relationship with App Service*: A resource group can contain multiple app services, allowing you to manage and deploy related web applications together.\n\n2. **App Service Plans**: An App Service Plan defines a set of compute resources that your app runs on, such as the number of virtual machines (VMs) and their size. It determines the amount of CPU, memory, and other resources allocated to your apps. You can choose from different pricing tiers, from Free to Premium, depending on your application's requirements.\n\n   - *Relationship with App Service*: Each app service must be associated with an app service plan. When you create an app service, you can either create a new app service plan or use an existing one. Multiple app services can share the same app service plan, allowing you to manage and scale resources efficiently.\n\n3. **Web Apps (App Services)**: A web app, also known as an app service, is the actual application that you deploy to Azure App Service. It represents a single web application, API, or mobile backend. You can create multiple web apps within the same resource group and app service plan.\n\n   - *Relationship with Resource Groups and App Service Plans*: A web app", "", ".\nIf it is stored from dashboard in 24 time formate it would appear in mobile in 24 rime formate.\nIf", " I'm looking for a list of features that I can use as a starting point.\n\n## Answer (1)\n\nI would suggest you to start with the following:\n\n1. **User Authentication** - Login, Register, Forgot Password, etc.\n2. **Dashboard** - Overview of all the bookings, quick stats, etc.\n3. **Bookings** - List of all the bookings, search/filter options, etc.\n4. **Add Booking** - Form to add a new booking, with all the necessary fields.\n5. **Edit Booking** - Form to edit an existing booking, with all the necessary fields.\n6. **Delete Booking** - Confirmation dialog to delete a booking.\n7. **Passengers** - List of all the passengers, search/filter options, etc.\n8. **Add Passenger** - Form to add a new passenger, with all the necessary fields.\n9. **Edit Passenger** - Form to edit an existing passenger, with all the necessary fields.\n10. **Delete Passenger** - Confirmation dialog to delete a passenger.\n11. **Flights** - List of all the flights, search/filter options, etc.\n12. **Add Flight** - Form to add a new flight, with all the necessary fields.\n13. **Edit Flight** - Form to edit an existing flight, with all the necessary fields.\n14. **Delete Flight** - Confirmation dialog to delete a flight.\n15. **Notifications** - List of all the notifications, search/filter options, etc.\n16. **Settings** - User profile, account settings, etc.\n17. **Help** - FAQs, support, etc.\n\nComment: Thanks for the list.

Here's a suggested itinerary for your day trip, focusing on historical sites, architectural marvels, and natural beauty, all within walking distance from the train station:\n\n1. **Train Station to Plaza de Espa\u00f1a (10 min walk)**\n   - Start your day by walking from the train station to the Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Vigo's main square. Here, you'll find the beautiful Pazo de Concello (City Hall) building, a great example of Vigo's architectural heritage.\n\n2. **Plaza de Espa\u00f1a to Casco Vello (Old Town) (15 min walk)**\n   - Head to the Casco Vello, Vigo's historic old town. Explore its narrow streets, traditional Galician architecture, and charming squares like Plaza de la Constituci\u00f3n and Plaza de la Princesa.\n\n3. **Casco Vello to Castro Fortress (15 min walk)**\n   - Walk up to the Castro Fortress, a medieval fortification that offers panoramic views of Vigo and", "\n\nIngredients:\n\n* 2 lbs (900g) of potatoes (preferably Bintje or Yukon Gold)\n* 1 cup (240ml) of vegetable oil\n* 1 large onion, thinly sliced\n* 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n* 1 tsp of salt\n* 1/2 tsp of black pepper\n* 1/2 tsp of paprika (optional)\n* Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. **Prepare the potatoes:** Wash the potatoes thoroughly and peel them if desired. Cut the potatoes into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick slices or sticks. Soak the cut potatoes in cold water for about 30 minutes to remove excess starch. After soaking, pat the potatoes dry with a clean kitchen towel to remove as much moisture as possible. This step is crucial for achieving crispy fried potatoes.\n\n2. **Heat the oil:** In a large, heavy-bottomed skillet or a deep fryer, heat the vegetable oil to 325\u00b0F (163\u00b0C). Use a deep-frying thermometer to monitor the oil temperature.\n\n3. **Fry the potatoes in batches:** Working in batches to avoid overcrowding the skillet, carefully add the potatoes to the hot oil. Fry the potatoes for about 5-7 minutes, or until they become soft and slightly golden.

There are many ways to build a recommendation engine. Here are some of the most common approaches:\n\n1. Collaborative Filtering: This approach uses the behavior of other users to make recommendations. For example, if user A has the same behavior as user B, then the items that user B liked might be recommended to user A.\n2. Content-based Filtering: This approach uses the content of the items to make recommendations. For example, if a user likes items that are described as \"funny\", then the system might recommend other items that are also described as \"funny\".\n3. Hybrid Approach: This approach combines the collaborative filtering and content-based filtering approaches. For example, the system might use collaborative filtering to find similar users and then use content-based filtering to find items that those users liked.\n4. Matrix Factorization: This approach uses matrix factorization to find the latent factors that explain the user-item interactions. For example, the system might use singular value decomposition (SVD) to find the latent factors that explain the ratings that users gave to items.\n5. Deep Learning: This approach uses deep learning models to make recommendations. For example, the system might use a", " Therefore, the total amount paid by the guest is \u20ac247.98, and the total amount received by the host is \u20ac215.6", " The town and county are united in their opposition to the project.\n\nHe noted the \"remarkable outpouring of opposition\" to Amazon's proposed data center and claimed that the vast majority of the", " I'm thinking of somewhere in Europe but open to other suggestions.

Welcome to American Eye Center Vietnam - the best eye clinic in Vietnam.\n\nBut before we get into all the amazing things that American Eye Center has to offer, let me tell you a little bit about my own journey. I've been wearing glasses since I was a kid, and let me tell you, it's been a love-hate relationship. I love being able to see the world clearly, but I hate the hassle of glasses - the constant cleaning, the fogging up, the fear of breaking them. And don't even get me started on contacts. The dryness, the discomfort, the constant worry about infections. It's enough to make anyone want to throw in the towel.\n\nBut then I heard about American Eye Center. I heard about their state-of-the-art technology, their experienced doctors, and their commitment to providing the best possible care for their patients. I heard about their laser eye surgery, a procedure that could potentially free me from the tyranny of glasses and contacts forever. And I thought, \"Why not? What do I have to lose?\"\n\nSo, I made an appointment, and let me tell you, from the moment I walked in the door, I knew I was in good hands. The clinic was clean, modern, and incredibly welcoming. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and genuinely cared about my well-being.

The motor driver has two input pins (IN1 and IN2) for each motor, which should be connected to digital pins on the Arduino. Also, connect the enable pins (ENA and ENB) to PWM-capable pins on the Arduino [[4](https://www.instructables.com/Monster-Motor-Shield-VNH2SP30/)].\n   - Connect the three ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) to the Arduino. Two sensors should be placed at the front of the cart to detect obstacles, and one should be placed at the back to detect if someone is following the cart. Connect the trigger and echo pins of the sensors to digital pins on the Arduino.\n   - Connect the DC motors to the motor driver output terminals.\n\n2. **Arduino Library and PWM:**\n   - To control the motors using PWM, you can use the Arduino's built-in `analogWrite()` function or libraries like PWMMotorControl [[2](https://github.com/ArminJo/PWMMotorControl)]. For this example, we'll use the built-in `analogWrite()` function.\n   - To understand PWM better, refer to the Arduino PWM tutorial [[3](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/SecretsOfArduinoPWM)].\n\n3. **Arduino Code:**\n   - Here's a basic Arduino sketch to get you started. This code assumes that you've connected the motor driver input pins to digital pins 2, 3, 4, and 5, and the enable pins to PWM-capable pins 9 and 10.

Here's a brief explanation:\n\n1. **Class Definition**: The class is named `Sample` and it has a single method that returns an instance of `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor`.\n\n2. **Bean Annotation**: The `@Bean` annotation is used to indicate that the method produces a bean managed by the Spring Container. The `\"encryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor1\"` string is the name of the bean.\n\n3. **Primary Annotation**: The `@Primary` annotation is used to indicate that this bean should be given preference when multiple beans of the same type are present in the container.\n\n4. **Method Parameters**: The method takes two parameters, both of type `Encryptor`. These are instances of `AppProtectEncryptor` and `KmsEncryptor` (presumably `heraEncryptor`).\n\n5. **Method Body**: Inside the method, a `LinkedHashMap` named `encryptors` is created. This map stores the names of the encryptors as keys and the encryptor instances as values. The map is then used to create a new instance of `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor` and this instance is returned.\n\nIn essence, this code is configuring Spring to manage an instance of `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor` that uses two other encryptors: `AppProtectEncryptor` and `KmsEncryptor`. The `@Primary` annotation ensures that this specific instance is used when an `EncryptionKeyCompositeEncryptor` is needed.", "", "\\_\\_\n\n**Project Proposal**\n\n**Title:** Enhancing Customer Experience through AI-Driven Personalized Recommendations in E-commerce Platforms\n\n**Introduction**\n\nIn the rapidly evolving e-commerce landscape, providing a seamless and personalized customer experience has become a critical factor for businesses to thrive and retain customers (Kotler & Keller, 2015). However, with the increasing number of products and customers, it has become challenging for e-commerce platforms to deliver tailored recommendations that cater to individual preferences. This project aims to address this challenge by developing an AI-driven personalized recommendation system that enhances customer experience and improves business outcomes.\n\n**Problem Statement**\n\nThe primary problem that this project seeks to address is the lack of personalized product recommendations in e-commerce platforms, which leads to customer dissatisfaction, increased bounce rates, and lost sales opportunities (Ding et al., 2020). Current recommendation systems often rely on collaborative filtering or content-based approaches, which may not capture the nuances of individual customer preferences and may result in irrelevant or repetitive recommendations (Adomavicius & Tuzhilin, 2005).\n\n**Project Objectives**\n\nThe main objectives of this project are:\n\n1. To develop an AI-driven personalized recommendation system that leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze customer behavior, preferences, and historical data.\n2. To improve the accuracy and relevance of product recommendations by incorporating contextual information, such as time, location, and user mood.\n3. To enhance customer experience by providing tailored and engaging product recommendations that cater to individual preferences and needs.\n4. To evaluate the performance of the recommendation system using appropriate metrics and user feedback.\n5. To provide actionable insights and recommendations to e-commerce businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and improve business outcomes.\n\n**Project Scope and Limitations**\n\nThis project will focus on developing and implementing an AI-driven personalized recommendation system for a hypothetical e-commerce platform, with a specific emphasis on the fashion and lifestyle category. The project will cover the following phases:\n\n1. Data collection and preprocessing\n2. Feature engineering and selection\n3. Model selection and training\n4. Model evaluation and optimization\n5. System integration and deployment\n6. User testing and feedback collection\n\nThe project will have the following limitations:\n\n1. The project will be conducted on a hypothetical e-commerce platform, and the results may not be directly applicable to real-world scenarios.\n2. The project will focus on a specific category of products, and the results may not be generalizable to other categories.\n3. The project will not address the ethical and privacy concerns related to the use of AI and customer data.\n\n**Research Methodology**\n\nThis project will employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The following methodologies will be used:\n\n1. **Data Collection:**\n\t*", ". She rolled a 7 and a 11.

The young man waved the wand over him, then proceeded to pat him down, checking his waistcoat, breeches, and even his boots.\n\nMeanwhile, Thomas Jefferson's spectacles caused some concern. \"Sir,\" the TSA agent said, \"I'm afraid I'll need to test these for explosives.\"\n\nJefferson, surprised, handed over his spectacles. The agent swabbed them with a cotton swab, then inserted it into a machine. After a moment, it beeped.\n\n\"Sir, I'm sorry, but your spectacles have tested positive for trace amounts of gunpowder.

However, students often struggled to go beyond surface-level insights and struggled to connect their findings to the design thinking process.\n\n**Development:**\n\n1. **User Interview Guide Enhancement:** I revised the user interview guide to encourage students to ask open-ended, probing questions that delve deeper into users' experiences, thoughts, and emotions. I also added questions that help students understand the user's context, goals, and challenges.\n\n2. **Empathy Mapping Template Expansion:** I expanded the empathy map template to include additional quadrants: \"Pains\" (challenges and frustrations), \"Gains\" (benefits and rewards), \"Context\" (environment and circumstances), and \"Barriers\" (obstacles and constraints). This expansion encourages students to consider a broader range of factors that influence user behavior and needs.\n\n3. **Insight Generation Workshop:** I introduced a new workshop component where students work in groups to analyze their empathy maps, identify patterns, and generate insights. This workshop includes a structured process for synthesizing data, clustering similar findings, and formulating actionable insights.\n\n4. **Connection to Design Thinking Phases:** I updated the activity instructions", "", " I would be very grateful.\n\nHere is the plan:\n\n1.

The implementation of CMMC has been underway since November 30, 2020, with a five-year phase-in period [[1](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/About/)]. As of March 2021, the DoD has been conducting an internal review of CMMC's implementation [[1](https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/About/)].\n\nCMMC 2.0, an updated version of the CMMC framework, was announced in November 2021. This update aims to simplify the original CMMC model and reduce the burden on small businesses. Here are some key changes in CMMC 2.0:\n\n1. **Reduced Levels**: CMMC 2.0 reduces the number of certification levels from five to three. The new levels are Basic, Good Cyber Hygiene, and Advanced [[2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/17/2021-24880/cybersecurity-maturity-model-certification-cmmc-20-updates-and-way-forward)].\n\n2. **Self-Assessment**: CMMC 2.0 allows organizations to perform self-assessments for the Basic level, reducing the need for third-party assessments [[2](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/11/17/2021-24880/cybersecurity-maturity-model-cert", " when I click on it.
