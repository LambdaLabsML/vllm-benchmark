The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to filter data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. The filter system should allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria.\n2. The filter system should support both basic and advanced filtering options.\n3. The filter system should provide a clear and user-friendly interface for setting filters.\n4. The filter system should support real-time filtering, meaning that changes to filters should be reflected immediately in the displayed data.\n5. The filter system should be customizable, allowing administrators to add, remove, or modify filters as needed.\n\n## Design\n\n### Basic Filters\n\nBasic filters will be simple dropdown menus that allow users to select a single value for each filter. For example, a basic filter for a product list might include options for filtering by category, price range, or brand.\n\n### Advanced Filters\n\nAdvanced filters will provide more complex filtering options, such as the ability to filter by multiple values, ranges, or custom conditions. For example, an advanced filter for a product list might allow", "\n\nIn the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is actively seeking a solution to a problem or need, and is proactively looking for a product or service that can help them. This is in contrast to a \"pull,\" where a customer is not actively seeking a solution, but is triggered or motivated to take action by an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a recommendation from a friend.\n\nIn other words, a push is when the customer is the one initiating the search for a solution, while a pull is when the solution is being pushed towards the customer. Understanding the difference between push and pull can help businesses better understand their customers' needs and develop more effective marketing and sales strategies.", "", "\n\nTo create a React and Node.js/Express web application for creating or adding dummy data and displaying it, follow the steps below:\n\n1.

This guide will focus on using an Arduino board, LM35 temperature sensor, and LCD display.\n\n1. Gather the necessary components:\n   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)\n   - LM35 temperature sensor\n   - LCD display (16x2 or similar)\n   - 10 K Ohm potentiometer\n   - Jumper wires\n   - Breadboard (optional)\n\n2. Install the required library:\n   - Open the Arduino IDE and go to Tools > Manage Libraries.\n   - Search for \"LiquidCrystal I2C\" and install the library by Frank de Brabander [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n3. Connect the components as follows:\n   - Connect the VCC and GND pins of the LM35 temperature sensor to the corresponding pins on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the analog output pin of the LM35 temperature sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the 10 K Ohm potentiometer between the VCC and GND pins on the Arduino board. The second pin of the potentiometer should be connected to pin 3 of the LCD. The first pin of the potentiometer should be connected to the + VCC.\n   - Connect the LCD display to the Arduino board according to the LCD's data sheet. Make sure to connect the LCD's power supply (VCC and GND) to the Arduino board as well.\n\n4. Write the Arduino code to read the temperature from the LM35 sensor, control the LCD display using the potentiometer, and display the temperature on the LCD. You can find a detailed example in the following tutorial:\n   - Arduino temperature sensor LCD: https://arduinog", "\n\nThe most quoted verse in the Bible is John 3:16, which is a passage that is often used to explain the Christian belief in the salvation offered through Jesus Christ.

By default, it uses a string comparison algorithm that is case-sensitive.\n\nIf you want to perform case-insensitive sorting, you can create a custom compare function that converts both strings to the same case (usually lowercase) before comparing them. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = ['Apple', 'apples', 'banana', 'Banana'];\n\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(array); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'banana', 'apples']\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase, and then the `localeCompare()` method to compare them. The `localeCompare()` method is a more sophisticated string comparison function that takes into account the user's locale settings.\n\nIf you don't need to consider the user's locale, you can also use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert both strings to uppercase before comparing them:\n\n```javascript\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toUpperCase().localeCompare(b.toUpperCase()));\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result as the previous example, but with all strings in uppercase.", "\n\nThe error message you're seeing is because the `using enum` feature is a C++20 feature, and your compiler is not set to support C++20.\n\nTo use `using enum`, you need to enable C++20 in your project settings.

Identifying a Need: The first step in the product design process is identifying a need or problem that the product will address. This can be done through market research, customer feedback, or by observing trends in the industry.\n\n2. Research and Analysis: Once a need has been identified, the product designer will conduct research to gather information about the target market, competitors, and available technologies. This may involve surveys, focus groups, and analysis of market data.\n\n3. Concept Development: Based on the research, the product designer will develop one or more concepts for the new product. These concepts will be described in detail, including the product's features, benefits, and how it will meet the identified need.\n\n4. Prototyping: The product designer will then create a prototype of the product. This is a working model that allows the designer to test the product's functionality, usability, and aesthetics. The prototype may go through several iterations as the designer refines the design based on feedback and testing.\n\n5. Testing and Evaluation: The prototype is then tested in real-world conditions to gather feedback from potential users. This feedback is used to make further refinements to the product design. The product may also be tested for safety, durability, and other technical requirements.\n\n6.

They were often depicted as beautiful, seductive, and mischievous, and were said to live in rivers and streams. They were also known as Naiads.\n\nOne of the most famous river nymphs was Melia, who was the mother of the hero Bellerophon. Melia was said to have been seduced by Poseidon, the god of the sea, and gave birth to Bellerophon as a result of their union.\n\nAnother famous river nymph was Leucothea, who was the daughter of the river god Achelous. Leucothea was said to have saved the hero Odysseus from drowning by giving him a magical cloak that allowed him to float on the water.\n\nRiver nymphs were often associated with fertility and were believed to have the power to grant blessings to those who worshiped them.

In natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV), embedding is often used to convert text or images into numerical vectors that can be used by machine learning algorithms.\n\nIn NLP, embedding is used to represent words as vectors in a high-dimensional space, where the vectors capture the semantic meaning of the words. For example, the vector for the word \"king\" might be close to the vectors for \"", "", "\n\nIn TypeORM, you can use the `json` or `jsonb` type to store JSON data in a PostgreSQL database. Here's an example of how you can define a field of type `json` in your entity:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Entity, PrimaryGeneratedColumn, Column } from \"typeorm\";\n\n@Entity()\nexport class YourEntity {\n    @PrimaryGeneratedColumn()\n    id: number;\n\n    @Column({ type: \"json\" })\n    yourJsonField: object;\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, `yourJsonField` is a field that can store JSON data.\n\nThe `json` type stores JSON data as a single JSON value, while the `jsonb` type stores JSON data as a JSONB value, which supports indexing and is more efficient for querying. However, the `jsonb` type does not support JSON functions like `->>` and `->`.\n\nYou can choose the type based on your specific use case and requirements. For more information, you can refer to the TypeORM documentation:\n\n- [TypeORM JSON Type](https://typeorm.io/#/guide/ty", "?\n\nYes, you can use a JavaScript regular expression (regex) to find the first set of numbers in a string.

This is done by introducing a piece of the virus (or a piece of its genetic material) into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies can then recognize and neutralize the virus if it enters the body in the future.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccines is determined through clinical trials, which are large studies conducted on a representative sample of the population. In these trials, a group of people are given the vaccine, while another group is given a placebo (a substance that has no therapeutic effect). The groups are then followed over time to see how many people in each group develop COVID-19. The vaccine is considered effective if it significantly reduces the number of cases of COVID-19 compared to the placebo group.\n\nIn addition to clinical trials, the effectiveness of the vaccines is also monitored after they are authorized for use in the general population. This is done through ongoing surveillance and monitoring of cases of COVID-19 in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals. This data is used to continuously assess the effectiveness of the vaccines and to identify any potential safety concerns.\n\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of the vaccines can vary depending on factors such as the specific vaccine being used, the age and health status of the individual being vaccinated, and the level of circulation", "?\n\nPolyfills are a way to provide modern browser features to older browsers that do not support them natively. They are typically small pieces of code that you can include in your project to make sure that your code works consistently across different browsers.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the `Array.from()` method, but you know that some older browsers do not support it, you can use a polyfill to make sure that it works in those browsers as well.\n\nPolyfills can be written in a variety of ways, but they typically involve checking the browser's capabilities and providing the missing functionality if it is not available. This can be done using feature detection, or by using a library like Modernizr.\n\nPolyfills are an important part of ensuring that your code is compatible with a wide range of browsers, and they can help you avoid having to write separate code for different browsers. However, they should be used judiciously, as they can add extra weight to your code and potentially introduce bugs if not implemented correctly.", "\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a group of dragon riders who have built a fortified base on a mountain made of dragon steel, the strongest material in the known world.

This allows refiners to free up capital, reduce financing costs, and manage price risk.\n\nHere are some specific benefits that refiners can gain from asset-backed trading:\n\n1. Improved liquidity: By monetizing their physical assets, refiners can free up capital that can be used for other purposes, such as investing in new projects, paying down debt, or improving working capital.\n2. Reduced financing costs: ABT can help refiners reduce their financing costs by providing an alternative source of funding that is often cheaper than traditional bank loans. This is because the counterparty providing the funding is typically a financial institution that specializes in commodity trading and has a lower cost of capital.\n3. Price risk management: ABT can help refiners manage price risk by allowing them to lock in the price of their physical assets at the time of the trade. This can help them avoid the volatility of commodity prices and provide more certainty in their cash flows.\n4.

This issue is particularly noticeable on mobile devices.\n\nThis lack of margin can lead to a poor user experience, as it may make the content appear cramped and difficult to read. It also increases the risk of users accidentally tapping on the edge of the screen instead of the intended content.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we recommend adding a margin around the content on the mobile checkout page to improve readability and usability.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Navigate to the Ruumur checkout page on a mobile device.\n2. Observe the content on the page, specifically the text and buttons.\n3. Notice that the content is positioned very close to the edge, with no margin.\n\nExpected Result:\n\nThe content on the mobile checkout page should have a margin around it, improving readability and usability.\n\nAttachments:\n\n[Screenshot of the mobile checkout page showing the content close to the edge]\n\nNotes:\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or", ".\n\nExample:\n\n```\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 7\nOutput: [1, 2, 3]\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 10\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 0\nOutput: []\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = -1\nOutput: []\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = -10\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nHere's a Python solution that uses a sliding window approach:\n\n```python\ndef longest_subarray(a, k):\n    total = 0\n    start = 0\n    max_length = 0\n\n    for end in range(len(a)):\n        total += a[end]\n\n        while total > k:\n            total -= a[start]\n            start += 1\n\n        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)\n\n    return a[start:start + max_length]\n\n```\n\nThis solution initializes the start and end pointers at the beginning of the array.

The manipulation of public opinion and the formation of organized habits, as described by Bernays, can be seen in the way that MK Ultra subjects are conditioned and controlled. The \"invisible government\" that Bernays speaks of is akin to the handlers who orchestrate the lives of MK Ultra subjects, shaping their thoughts, actions, and beliefs in ways that serve their own interests. The \"vast numbers of human beings\" who must cooperate in a smoothly functioning society, as Bernays suggests, can be seen in the way that MK Ultra subjects are expected to conform to the expectations and demands of their handlers.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe quote also highlights the role of propaganda in shaping public opinion and controlling the masses. In the case of MK Ultra subjects, this propaganda takes the form of suggestions, commands, and other forms of mental manipulation that are designed to create a specific response or behavior. The \"men we have never heard of\" who Bernays speaks of can be seen in the handlers who orchestrate the lives of MK Ultra subjects, operating behind the scenes and pulling the strings that control their thoughts and actions. The \"mental processes and social patterns of the masses\" that Bernays refers to can be seen in the way that MK Ultra subjects are conditioned to respond to certain stimuli and to conform to the expectations of their handlers.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThe quote also raises questions about the ethics of manipulating the minds of others for one's own gain. In the case of MK Ultra, this manipulation is carried out in the name of national security, but it raises serious ethical concerns about the rights and autonomy of individuals. The fact that MK Ultra subjects are often unaware of the extent to which they are being manipulated and controlled adds to the ethical complexity of the situation. The quote by Bernays serves as a reminder that the manipulation of public opinion and the control of the masses is a powerful tool, but one that must be used with caution and ethical consideration.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe quote also highlights the importance of critical thinking and the ability to question authority. In the case of MK Ultra subjects, this ability is often suppressed or compromised through the use of mind control techniques. However, the quote by Bernays serves as a call to arms for those who are willing to question the status quo and", "\n\nAzure App Services is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft that allows developers to easily build, deploy, and manage web applications and APIs in the cloud. It provides a fully managed environment for hosting web applications, including support for a variety of programming languages, databases, and operating systems.\n\nResource Groups:\n\nResource groups are a logical container for managing and deploying Azure resources. They provide a way to group related resources together, such as web apps, databases, and storage accounts, and manage them as a single unit. Resource groups can be used to enforce access control, apply tags for cost management and monitoring, and simplify the deployment and management of resources.\n\nPlans:\n\nApp Service plans define the compute resources and scaling options for web apps and APIs deployed to Azure App Services. There are several types of plans available, including:\n\n* Free: A basic plan that allows you to host a web app or API for free, with limited resources and features.\n* Shared: A low-cost plan that shares resources with other web apps and APIs, providing a cost-effective option for small-scale applications.\n* Dedicated: A plan that provides dedicated resources for a single web app or API, offering better performance and scalability.\n* Virtual Machine (VM) scale sets: A plan that allows you to deploy and manage a group of virtual machines (VMs) as a single unit, providing high scalability and flexibility.\n\nRelationships:\n\nResource groups and App Service plans are related in that they are both used to manage and deploy resources in Azure. A resource group can contain one or more App Service plans, and each App Service plan can host one or more web apps or APIs.\n\nFor example, you might create a resource group to manage all of the resources for a particular project, and then create an App Service plan within that resource group to host the web app for that project. You can then deploy the web app to the App Service plan, and manage it along with other resources in the resource", "\n\n---\n\nSubject: KSAA Newsletter Submission - University of Auckland\n\nDear Hyein,\n\nI am writing to submit our team's achievements for the KSAA newsletter.

Here's a step-by-step guide:\n\n1. First, ensure you have the AWS EC2 facts collected by Ansible. If you're using the default `aws.ec2` module, it should be available.\n\n2. Create your Jinja2 templates in a directory, for example, `templates/`. Let's assume you have two templates: `config.j2` and `config_alternative.j2`.\n\n3. In your playbook, use the `set_fact` and `when` statements to check the EC2 tag and set the appropriate template.\n\n```yaml\n- hosts: your_ec2_instance\n  gather_facts: yes\n  tasks:\n    - name: Get EC2 instance tag\n      aws_ec2_tag:\n        name: your_ec2_instance\n        region: us-west-2\n        filters:\n          instance-id: i-your_ec2_instance_id\n      register: ec2_tag\n\n    - name: Set template based on tag\n      set_fact:\n        config_template: config.j2\n      when: ec2_tag.tags['YourTag'] == 'your_tag_value'\n\n    - name: Include the selected template\n      include_template:\n        src: \"{{ config_template }}\"\n        dest: /path/to/your/config/file\n```\n\nReplace `your_ec2_instance`, `us-west-2`, `i-your_ec2_instance_id`, `YourTag`, and `your_tag_value` with your actual EC2 instance name, region, instance ID, tag key, and tag value.\n\n4.

Resolution: Set the camera to 6K (6144 x 3456) for the highest possible quality. If you need to reduce file size, you can also use 4K (4096 x 2160) or 5K (5616 x 3184).\n\n2. Frame Rate: Choose a frame rate that matches the frame rate of your final video. Common frame rates for YouTube are 24fps, 25fps, 30fps, or 60fps. If you're shooting slow-motion, you can use higher frame rates like 120fps or 240fps.\n\n3. Codec: Use Blackmagic RAW or ProRes 422 HQ for the best image quality. Blackmagic RAW offers more flexibility in post-production, while ProRes 422 HQ provides a good balance between quality and file size.\n\n4. ISO: Set the ISO based on the available light. A lower ISO (100-400) is ideal for well-lit scenes, while a higher ISO (800-3200) may be necessary for low-light situations. Try to avoid going above ISO 6400 to minimize noise.\n\n5. Shutter Angle: For a natural motion blur, set the shutter angle to double the frame rate. For example, if you're shooting at 24fps, set the shutter angle to 1/48th of a second (90 degrees).\n\n6. White Balance: Set the white balance manually to match the lighting conditions. You can also adjust white balance in post-production if necessary.\n\n7. Exposure: Use the histogram to ensure proper exposure. Aim for the right side of the histogram to avoid underexposure, but avoid clipping on the right side to prevent overexposure.\n\n8. Focus: Use manual focus to ensure sharp images. You can also use autofocus, but be aware that it may not always be accurate, especially in low-light situations.\n\nFor lighting, here are some general tips:\n\n1. Use three-point lighting: Key light (main light), fill light (softens shadows), and back light (separates subject from background).\n\n2. Position lights carefully: Adjust the position, angle, and intensity of each light to create the desired effect.\n\n3. Use softboxes or diffusers: Soften harsh light to reduce shadows and create a more flattering look.\n\n4. Use reflectors: Bounce light back onto the subject to fill in shadows and soften the overall look.\n\n5. Balance the lights: Ensure that all lights are balanced to avoid uneven exposure.\n\n6.

This is also known as virtual memory.\n\nWhen a process needs more memory than what is currently available in the RAM, the operating system swaps out (or pages out) some of the less frequently used data or pages from the RAM to the hard disk. This frees up memory for the process that needs it. Later, when the swapped-out data is needed again, it is swapped back (or paged in) into the RAM.\n\nSwapping can help manage memory efficiently, but it can also slow down the system because accessing the hard disk is much slower than accessing the RAM.
