The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to filter data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. The filter system should allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria.\n2. The filter system should provide a clear and user-friendly interface for applying filters.\n3. The filter system should support complex filtering logic, such as AND, OR, and NOT operations.\n4. The filter system should be able to handle large datasets efficiently.\n5. The filter system should be customizable, allowing developers to add new filters as needed.\n\n## Design\n\n### Data Model\n\nThe data model will consist of a `Filter` class and a `Filterable` interface. The `Filter` class will represent a single filter, while the `Filterable` interface will be implemented by any class that can be filtered.\n\n```java\npublic interface Filterable {\n    void applyFilter(Filter filter);\n}\n```\n\n```java\npublic abstract class Filter {\n    protected Filterable data;\n\n    public Filter(Filterable data) {\n        this", "\n\nIn the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is actively seeking a solution to a problem or need, and is proactively looking for a product or service that can help them. This is in contrast to a \"pull,\" where a customer is not actively seeking a solution, but is triggered or motivated to take action by an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a recommendation from a friend.\n\nIn other words, a push is when the customer is the one initiating the search for a solution, while a pull is when the solution is being pushed towards the customer. Understanding the difference between push and pull can help businesses better understand their customers' needs and develop more effective marketing and sales strategies.", "", "\n\nTo create a React and Node.js/Express web application for creating or adding dummy data and displaying it, follow the steps below:\n\n1.

This guide will focus on using an Arduino board, LM35 temperature sensor, and LCD display.\n\n1. Gather the necessary components:\n   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)\n   - LM35 temperature sensor\n   - LCD display (16x2 or similar)\n   - 10 K Ohm potentiometer\n   - Jumper wires\n   - Breadboard (optional)\n\n2. Install the required library:\n   - Open the Arduino IDE and go to Tools > Manage Libraries.\n   - Search for \"LiquidCrystal I2C\" and install the library by Frank de Brabander [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n3. Connect the components as follows:\n   - Connect the VCC and GND pins of the LM35 temperature sensor to the corresponding pins on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the analog output pin of the LM35 temperature sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the 10 K Ohm potentiometer between the VCC and GND pins on the Arduino board. The second pin of the potentiometer should be connected to pin 3 of the LCD. The first pin of the potentiometer should be connected to the + VCC.\n   - Connect the LCD display according to its datasheet, ensuring that the contrast is adjusted using the potentiometer.\n\n4. Write the Arduino code to read the temperature from the LM35 sensor, control the LCD display, and adjust the LCD contrast using the potentiometer.

The verse reads: \"For God so loved", "\n\nIn JavaScript, the `Array.prototype.sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in a specific order. By default, it uses a string comparison algorithm that is case-sensitive.\n\nIf you want to perform case-insensitive sorting, you can create a custom compare function that converts both strings to the same case (usually lowercase) before comparing them. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = ['Apple', 'apples', 'banana', 'Banana'];\n\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(array); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'banana', 'apples']\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase, and then the `localeCompare()` method to compare them. The `localeCompare()` method is a more sophisticated string comparison function that takes into account the user's locale settings.\n\nIf you don't need to consider the user's locale, you can also use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert both strings to uppercase before comparing them:\n\n```javascript\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toUpperCase().localeCompare(b.toUpperCase()));\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result as the previous example, but with all strings in uppercase.", "\n\nThe error message you're seeing is because the `using enum` feature is a C++20 feature, and your compiler is not set to support C++20.\n\nTo use `using enum`, you need to enable C++20 in your compiler settings.

Concept Development: Based on the research, the product designer will develop one or more concepts for the product. This may involve sketching, prototyping, and brainstorming sessions.\n\n4. Prototyping: The product designer will create a prototype of the product to test its feasibility and usability. This prototype may be a physical model, a digital model, or a detailed description of the product.\n\n5. Testing and Iteration: The prototype is then tested with potential users to gather feedback. Based on this feedback, the product designer will make necessary adjustments and improvements to the design. This process of testing and iteration may be repeated several times until the product meets the desired specifications.\n\n6.

However, `jsonb` does not support JSON functions like `json_array_elements` and `json_build_object`.\n\nYou can choose the type that best fits your use case.

This is done by introducing a piece of the virus (or a piece of its genetic material) into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies can then recognize and fight off the virus if the person is exposed to it in the future.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccines is determined through clinical trials, which are large studies conducted on a representative sample of people to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new drug or vaccine. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the trials involved thousands of participants who were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo (a harmless substance). The participants were then followed for several months to see how many people in each group developed COVID-19.\n\nThe results of the clinical trials showed that the vaccines were highly effective at preventing COVID-19, with efficacy rates of 95% or higher for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and 70-75% for the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines. These results were based on the number of cases of COVID-19 that occurred in the trial participants during the study period.\n\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of the vaccines may vary depending on factors such as the age and health status of", "?\n\nPolyfills are a way to provide modern browser functionality to older browsers that do not support it natively.

This allows refiners to free up capital, reduce financing costs, and manage price risk.\n\nHere are some specific benefits that a refiner can gain from asset-backed trading:\n\n1. Improved liquidity: By selling their physical assets, refiners can free up capital that can be used for other purposes, such as investing in new equipment or paying down debt. This can help refiners to manage their cash flow more effectively and improve their overall financial position.\n2. Reduced financing costs: Asset-backed trading can help refiners to reduce their financing costs by allowing them to access lower-cost financing from counterparties. This is because the counterparty is taking on the credit risk of the physical assets, which can be lower than the credit risk of the refiner.\n3. Price risk management: Asset-backed trading can help refiners to manage price risk by allowing them to lock in the price of their physical assets at the time of the sale.

Hades felt a sense of excitement and anticipation, but he also felt a growing sense of unease.\n\nOne night, as Hades lay in his bed, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was wrong. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep. Finally, he got up and went to the window, looking out at the city below.\n\nThat's when he saw it.

This issue is particularly noticeable on mobile devices.\n\nThis lack of margin can lead to a poor user experience, as it may make the content appear cramped and difficult to read. It also increases the risk of users accidentally tapping on the edge of the screen instead of the intended content.\n\nTo resolve this issue, we recommend adding a margin around the content on the mobile checkout page to improve readability and usability.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Navigate to the Ruumur checkout page on a mobile device.\n2. Observe the content on the page, specifically the text and buttons.\n3. Notice that the content is positioned very close to the edge, with no margin.\n\nExpected Result:\n\nThe content on the mobile checkout page should have a margin around it to improve readability and usability.\n\nAttachments:\n\n[Screenshot of the mobile checkout page showing the content close to the edge]\n\nNotes:\n\nPlease let me know if you need any additional information or", ".\n\nExample:\n\n```\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 7\nOutput: [1, 2, 3]\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 10\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = 0\nOutput: []\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = -1\nOutput: []\n\nInput: a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], k = -10\nOutput: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\nHere's a Python solution that uses a sliding window approach:\n\n```python\ndef longest_subarray(a, k):\n    total = 0\n    start = 0\n    max_length = 0\n\n    for end in range(len(a)):\n        total += a[end]\n\n        while total > k:\n            total -= a[start]\n            start += 1\n\n        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)\n\n    return a[start:start + max_length]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(longest_subarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 7))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]\nprint(longest_subarray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10))", "", " - Edward Bernays, Propaganda\n\nParagraph 1:\nIn the context of this thread, the quote by Edward Bernays serves as a chilling reminder of the power dynamics that underlie our democratic society. The manipulation of public opinion and the formation of organized habits, as described by Bernays, can be seen in the way that MK Ultra subjects are conditioned and controlled. The \"invisible government\" that Bernays speaks of is akin to the handlers who orchestrate the lives of MK Ultra subjects, shaping their thoughts, actions, and beliefs to serve a hidden agenda. The vast numbers of human beings who must cooperate in this manner to live together as a smoothly functioning society, as Bernays suggests, can be seen in the way that MK Ultra subjects are expected to conform to the expectations and demands of their handlers.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe quote also highlights the role of the \"relatively small number of persons\" who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses, a group that includes MK Ultra handlers. These individuals have a profound impact on the lives of MK Ultra subjects, manipulating their thoughts and actions to serve their own purposes. This manipulation is not always overt, but rather occurs through subtle means such as suggestion and conditioning. The result is a population of individuals who are largely unaware of the extent to which they are being controlled.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThe quote also speaks to the idea of democratic society being organized in a way that allows for the manipulation of the masses. In the case of MK Ultra, this organization takes the form of a highly structured system of control, with handlers at the top and subjects at the bottom. The handlers have the power to shape the lives of their subjects, using a variety of techniques to ensure compliance and obedience. This system of control is hidden from view, making it difficult for subjects to escape or resist.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe quote also raises questions about the ethics of manipulating the thoughts and actions of large numbers of people. While Bernays presents this manipulation as a necessary element of democratic society, it is clear that it can have harmful consequences for those who are being manipulated. In the case of MK Ultra, the manipulation of subjects has resulted in a lifetime of trauma and suffering. It is important to consider the ethical implications of such manipulation and to strive for a society in which individuals are free to think and act for themselves.\n\nParagraph 5:\nFinally, the quote serves as a call to action for those who are concerned about the manipulation", "\n\nAzure App Services is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft that allows developers to easily build, deploy, and manage web applications and APIs in the cloud. It provides a fully managed environment for hosting web applications, including support for a variety of programming languages, databases, and operating systems.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Azure App Services is the use of resource groups. A resource group is a logical container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. Resources in a resource group can be managed as a single unit, and can be deployed, updated, and deleted together. For example, you might create a resource group that contains an App Service plan, a web app, a database, and a storage account, all of which are related to a specific project or application.\n\nAn App Service plan is a service plan that defines the scaling, performance, and pricing tier for an App Service. When you create a web app in Azure App Services, you must associate it with an App Service plan. The plan determines the number of instances that can be used to run your web app, as well as the maximum number of concurrent requests that can be handled. There are several different App Service plans available, ranging from free (which is limited in terms of resources and features) to premium (which offers the highest level of performance and scalability).\n\nThe relationship between resource groups, App Service plans, and web apps is as follows:\n\n* A resource group contains one or more resources, including App Service plans and web apps.\n* An App Service plan defines the scaling, performance, and pricing tier for one or more web apps.\n* A web app is a specific instance of an application that is hosted in Azure App Services. Each web app is associated with a single App Service plan.\n\nYou can create and manage resource groups, App Service plans, and web apps using the Azure portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or other Azure SDKs and tools. You can also use Azure DevOps or other continuous integration and deployment tools to automate the deployment of your web apps to", "\n\n---\n\nSubject: KSAA Newsletter Submission - University of Auckland\n\nDear Hyein,\n\nI am writing to submit our team's achievements for the KSAA newsletter.

Create your Jinja2 templates in a directory, for example, `templates/`. Let's assume you have two templates: `config.j2` and `config_alt.j2`.\n\n3.

Resolution: Set the camera to 6K (6144 x 3456) for the highest possible resolution. However, if your internet connection or upload speed is limited, you can also use 4K (4096 x 2160) or 1080p (1920 x 1080).\n\n2. Frame Rate: Choose a frame rate that matches the desired look and feel of your video. Common frame rates for YouTube are 24fps, 25fps, 30fps, and 60fps. If you're shooting slow-motion footage, you can use higher frame rates like 120fps or 240fps.\n\n3. Codec: Use the Blackmagic RAW or ProRes 422 codec for the best image quality. Blackmagic RAW offers more flexibility in post-production, while ProRes 422 provides a good balance between quality and file size.\n\n4. ISO: Set the ISO based on the available light. A lower ISO (100-400) is ideal for well-lit scenes, while a higher ISO (800-3200) may be necessary for low-light situations. Try to avoid pushing the ISO above 6400, as it can introduce noise and loss of detail.\n\n5. Shutter Angle: To achieve a natural motion blur, set the shutter angle to double the frame rate. For example, if you're shooting at 24fps, set the shutter angle to 1/48th of a second (90 degrees).\n\n6. White Balance: Set the white balance manually to match the lighting conditions. You can use a white or gray card for reference.\n\n7. Exposure: Adjust the exposure using the iris, gain, or ISO to achieve the desired brightness and contrast. Aim for an exposure of around 0 to +1 stop overexposed for a more cinematic look.\n\n8. Focus: Use manual focus to ensure sharp images. You can also use focus pulls or racks for added visual interest.\n\nFor lighting, here are some general tips:\n\n1. Use three-point lighting: Key light (main light), fill light (softens shadows), and back light (separates subject from background).\n\n2. Position the key light 45 degrees to the subject's left or right to create a Rembrandt lighting pattern.\n\n3. Use softboxes or diffusers to soften harsh light and prevent harsh shadows.\n\n4. Use reflectors or bounce cards to fill in shadows and add more light to the subject.\n\n5. Avoid using on-camera lights, as they can create unwanted shadows and reflections.\n\n6.

We can assist in generating code snippets, suggest solutions to coding problems, or help explain complex code, but we don't have the ability to fully understand the context, dependencies, and potential errors in a way that would allow us to write complete, production-ready code.\n\nHowever, there are ongoing research efforts in the field of AI and programming, such as AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) and Codex by OpenAI, which aim to bridge this gap.

This is done when the main memory is not large enough to hold all the required data for a process, or when a process is not actively using its data.\n\nWhen a process needs to access data that has been swapped out, the operating system swaps the required data back into the main memory, a process known as paging. This process is known as virtual memory.\n\nSwapping can help improve system performance by allowing more processes to run concurrently than would be possible if all data had to be stored in the main memory at once. However, swapping can also cause delays because of the time it takes to read and write data to the secondary storage.
