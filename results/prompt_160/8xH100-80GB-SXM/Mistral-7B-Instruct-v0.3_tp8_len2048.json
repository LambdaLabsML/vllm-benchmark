The goal is to improve the user experience by providing a more intuitive and efficient way to filter data.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. The filter system should allow users to filter data based on multiple criteria.\n2. The filter system should support both basic and advanced filtering options.\n3. The filter system should provide a clear and user-friendly interface for setting filters.\n4. The filter system should support real-time filtering, meaning that changes to filters should be reflected immediately in the displayed data.\n5. The filter system should be customizable, allowing administrators to add, remove, or modify filters as needed.\n\n## Design\n\n### Basic Filters\n\nBasic filters will be simple dropdown menus that allow users to select a single value for each filter. For example, a basic filter for a product list might include options for filtering by category, price range, or brand.\n\n### Advanced Filters\n\nAdvanced filters will provide more complex filtering options, such as the ability to filter by multiple values, ranges, or custom conditions. For example, an advanced filter for a product list might allow", "\n\nIn the Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is actively seeking a solution to a problem or need. This is in contrast to a \"pull,\" where a customer is not actively seeking a solution but is influenced or motivated to take action by an external factor, such as a marketing campaign or a recommendation from a friend.\n\nIn other words, a push is a proactive approach to solving a customer's job, while a pull is a reactive approach. The JTBD framework emphasizes understanding the underlying jobs that customers are trying to get done, and then designing products or services that effectively solve those jobs for them. By understanding the customer's job and the context in which it is being done, companies can create solutions that are more likely to be successful and meet the customer's needs.", "", "\n\nTo create a React and Node.js/Express web application for creating or adding dummy data and displaying it, you can follow the steps below:\n\n1. Set up the project structure:\n\n```\nmy-app/\n  |- client/\n    |- public/\n      |- index.html\n      |- favicon.ico\n    |- src/\n      |- App.js\n      |- index.js\n      |- components/\n        |- DummyDataForm.js\n        |- DummyDataList.js\n      |- utils/\n        |- api.js\n  |- server/\n    |- index.js\n    |- routes/\n      |- api.js\n    |- models/\n      |- DummyData.js\n    |- controllers/\n      |- DummyDataController.js\n```\n\n2. Install dependencies for the client-side (React):\n\n```\ncd client\nnpx create-react-app .\n```\n\n3. Install dependencies for the server-side (Node.js/Express):\n\n```\ncd ..\nnpm init -y\nnpm install express body-parser cors mongoose\n```\n\n4. Set up the server-side:\n\n- Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory to store environment variables like the MongoDB connection string.\n- Create a `routes/api.js` file to define the API routes.\n- Create a `models/DummyData.js` file to define the Mongoose schema for the dummy data.\n- Create a `controllers/DummyDataController.js` file to handle the API requests.\n- Update the `server/index.js` file to set up the Express server, use the controllers, and use the defined routes.\n\n5. Set up the client-side:\n\n- In `client/src/utils/api.js`, create a function to make API requests to the server.\n- In `client/src/components/DummyDataForm.js`, create a form to add new dummy data.\n- In `client/src/components/DummyDataList.js`, create a list to display the dummy data fetched from the server.\n- Update `client/src/App.js` to use the `DummyDataForm` and `DummyDataList` components.\n\n6. Build the client-side:\n\n```\ncd client\nnpm run build\n```\n\n7. Serve the client-side and the server-side:\n\n```\ncd ..\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNow you should have a development server running at `http://localhost:3000`.\n\n8. To deploy the application, you can use services like Heroku, Netlify, or AWS.\n\nFor Heroku:\n\n- Install the Heroku CLI: `npm install -g heroku`\n- Login to Heroku: `heroku login`\n- Create a new Heroku app: `heroku create my-app`\n- Install the necessary dependencies for production: `npm install --production`\n- Create a `Procfile` in the root directory with the following content:\n\n```\nweb: node server/\nclient: npm start\n```\n\n- Push the code to Heroku:\n\n```\ngit init\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"Initial commit\"\nheroku git:remote -a my-app\ngit push heroku master\n```\n\n- In the Heroku dashboard, go to the Settings tab, and add the MongoDB connection string from your MongoDB Atlas account to the Config Vars section.\n- In the Heroku dashboard, go to the Manage Add-ons tab, and add the Heroku Postgres add-on if you haven't already.\n- In the Heroku dashboard, go to the Config Vars section, and set the `NODE_ENV` variable to `production`.\n- In the Heroku dashboard, go to the Buildpacks section, and add the following buildpacks:\n\n```", " You may also want to consider using a more advanced", "\n\nThe sun set on the horizon, casting a warm glow over the survivors as they looked out at the sea, their", " (englisch f\u00fcr *Hil", " is a procedure or means of determining the presence, quality, or truth of something.

This guide will focus on using an Arduino board, LM35 temperature sensor, and LCD display.\n\n1. Gather the necessary components:\n   - Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)\n   - LM35 temperature sensor\n   - LCD display (16x2 or similar)\n   - 10 K Ohm potentiometer\n   - Jumper wires\n   - Breadboard (optional)\n\n2. Install the required library:\n   - Open the Arduino IDE and go to Tools > Manage Libraries.\n   - Search for \"LiquidCrystal I2C\" and install the library by Frank de Brabander [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n\n3. Connect the components as follows:\n   - Connect the VCC and GND pins of the LM35 temperature sensor to the corresponding pins on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the analog output pin of the LM35 temperature sensor to an analog input pin (e.g., A0) on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the wires of the 10 K Ohm potentiometer to the Arduino board as follows:\n     - One end of the potentiometer to the +VCC pin on the Arduino board.\n     - The middle pin of the potentiometer to pin 3 of the LCD (for backlight control).\n     - The other end of the potentiometer to the GND pin on the Arduino board.\n   - Connect the LCD display to the I2C pins (A4 and A5) on the Arduino board, as well as the VCC, GND, and contrast pins (if applicable).\n\n4.

The verse reads:\n\n\"For God", "\n\nIn JavaScript, the `Array.prototype.sort()` method sorts the elements of an array in a specific order. By default, it uses a string comparison algorithm that is case-sensitive.\n\nIf you want to perform case-insensitive sorting, you can create a custom compare function that converts both strings to the same case (usually lowercase) before comparing them. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nconst array = ['Apple', 'apples', 'banana', 'Banana'];\n\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(array); // Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'banana', 'apples']\n```\n\nIn this example, we use the `toLowerCase()` method to convert both strings to lowercase, and then the `localeCompare()` method to compare them. The `localeCompare()` method is a more sophisticated string comparison function that takes into account the user's locale settings.\n\nIf you don't need to consider the user's locale, you can also use the `toUpperCase()` method to convert both strings to uppercase before comparing them:\n\n```javascript\narray.sort((a, b) => a.toUpperCase().localeCompare(b.toUpperCase()));\n```\n\nThis will give you the same result as the previous example, but with all strings in uppercase.", "\n\nThe error message you're seeing is because the `using enum` feature is a C++20 feature, and your compiler is not set to support C++20.\n\nTo use `using enum`, you need to enable C++20 in your project settings.

Identifying a Need: The first step in the product design process is identifying a need or problem that the product will address. This can be done through market research, customer feedback, or by observing trends in the industry.\n\n2. Research and Analysis: Once a need has been identified, the product designer will conduct research to gather information about the target market, competitors, and available technologies. This may involve conducting surveys, focus groups, or analyzing market data.\n\n3. Concept Development: Based on the research, the product designer will develop one or more concepts for the new product. This may involve sketching, prototyping, and brainstorming sessions.\n\n4. Prototyping: The product designer will create a prototype of the product to test its feasibility and usability. This may be a physical model or a digital prototype.\n\n5. Testing and Iteration: The prototype will be tested with potential users to gather feedback and identify any issues or areas for improvement. The product designer will then make necessary adjustments to the design based on the feedback received.\n\n6. Refining the Design: The product designer will refine the design based on the feedback received during testing. This may involve making changes to the product's features, materials, or user interface.\n\n7.

They were often depicted as beautiful, seductive, and mischievous, and were said to live in rivers and streams. They were also known as naiads.\n\nOne of the most famous river nymphs was Melia, who was the mother of the hero Bellerophon. Melia was said to have been seduced by Poseidon, the god of the sea, and gave birth to Bellerophon as a result. Another famous river nymph was Arethusa, who was pursued by the river god Alpheus and was transformed into a stream by Zeus in order to escape him.\n\nRiver nymphs were often associated with fertility and were believed to have the power to heal. They were also said to be able to control the weather and the flow of rivers.

However, the `jsonb` type does not support JSON functions like `->>` and `->`.\n\nYou can choose the type based on your specific use case and requirements.

This is done by introducing a piece of the virus (or a piece of the virus's genetic material) into the body, which triggers the immune system to produce antibodies against the virus. These antibodies can then recognize and fight off the virus if the person is exposed to it in the future.\n\nThe effectiveness of the vaccines is determined through clinical trials, which are large studies conducted on a representative sample of people to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new vaccine. In the case of the COVID-19 vaccines, the trials involved thousands of participants who were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or a placebo (a harmless substance). The participants were then followed for several months to see how many people in each group developed COVID-19.\n\nThe results of the clinical trials showed that the vaccines were highly effective at preventing COVID-19, with efficacy rates of 95% or higher for the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, and 70-75% for the Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines. These results were based on the number of cases of COVID-19 that occurred in the trial participants during the study period.\n\nIt is important to note that the effectiveness of the vaccines may vary depending on factors such as the age and health status", "?\n\nPolyfills are a way to provide modern browser features to older browsers that do not support them natively. They are typically small pieces of code that you can include in your project to make sure that your code works consistently across different browsers.\n\nFor example, if you want to use the `Array.from()` method, but you know that some older browsers do not support it, you can use a polyfill to make sure that it works in those browsers as well.\n\nPolyfills can be implemented in different ways, but they typically involve checking the browser's capabilities and providing the missing functionality if it is not available. This can be done using feature detection, or by using a library like Modernizr.\n\nPolyfills are an important part of writing cross-browser compatible code, and they can help you avoid having to write separate code for different browsers. However, it's important to use them judiciously, as they can add extra weight to your code and potentially introduce bugs if not implemented correctly.", "\n\nThe Oshiran Riders are a group of dragon riders who have built a fortified base on a mountain made of dragon steel, the strongest material in the known world.

This allows refiners to free up capital, reduce financing costs, and manage price risk.\n\nHere are some specific benefits that a refiner can gain from asset-backed trading:\n\n1. Improved liquidity: By monetizing their physical assets, refiners can free up capital that can be used for other purposes, such as investing in new projects, paying down debt, or improving working capital.\n2. Reduced financing costs: ABT can help refiners reduce their financing costs by providing an alternative source of funding that is often cheaper than traditional bank loans. This is because the counterparty providing the funding is typically a financial institution that specializes in commodity trading and has a lower cost of capital.\n3. Price risk management: ABT can help refiners manage price risk by allowing them to lock in the price of their physical assets at the time of the trade. This can help them avoid the volatility of commodity prices and provide more certainty in their cash flows.\n4.

He sent his minions to take over various parts of the empire, and Jafar's power began to wane. Hades felt a sense of excitement, but also a growing sense of unease. He knew that Hook was a master manipulator, and he couldn't help but wonder if he was being used.\n\nOne day, as Hades was walking through the palace, he overheard a conversation between two of Hook's minions. They were discussing a plan to eliminate Hades and take control of the empire for themselves.\n\nHades felt a cold chill run down his spine. He knew that he had been played, and that he was in grave danger. He quickly made his way back to his office and locked the door, trying to think of a way to save himself.\n\nBut it was too late. Hook's minions burst into the office, weapons drawn. Hades knew that he was outnumbered and outmatched, and he braced himself for the worst.\n\nAs the minions closed in, Hades felt a sudden surge of power. He raised his hands and unleashed a torrent of fire, burning the minions to a crisp.\n\nBut it was too little, too late.

The manipulation of public opinion and the formation of organized habits, as described by Bernays, can be seen in the way that MK Ultra subjects are conditioned and controlled. The \"invisible government\" that Bernays speaks of is akin to the handlers who orchestrate the lives of MK Ultra subjects, shaping their thoughts, actions, and beliefs to serve a hidden agenda. The vast numbers of human beings who are dominated by a small number of manipulators can be compared to the multitude of MK Ultra subjects who are unaware of their own conditioning and the true nature of their handlers.\n\nParagraph 2:\nThe quote also sheds light on the role of propaganda in shaping public opinion, a tactic that is central to the MK Ultra program. The handlers use various forms of propaganda to control the thoughts and actions of their subjects, from subtle suggestions to overt brainwashing techniques. This manipulation of the public mind is a logical result of the way our democratic society is organized, as Bernays suggests, and it is a powerful tool that can be used to maintain control over large numbers of people. In the case of MK Ultra subjects, this control is often used to serve the interests of the government or other powerful entities.\n\nParagraph 3:\nThe quote highlights the importance of understanding the mental processes and social patterns of the masses, a skill that is essential for those who seek to manipulate public opinion. This understanding is crucial for the handlers of MK Ultra subjects, who must carefully craft their propaganda to appeal to the specific beliefs, values, and fears of their subjects. By understanding the psychological makeup of their subjects, the handlers can more effectively control their thoughts and actions, ensuring that they remain loyal and obedient.\n\nParagraph 4:\nThe quote also underscores the fact that those who wield this power are often hidden from view, operating behind the scenes to shape the thoughts and actions of the masses. This is true of the handlers of MK Ultra subjects, who often work in secret to control their subjects' lives. The handlers' influence is felt in every aspect of the subjects' lives, from their political beliefs to their social interactions, and their control is often so complete that the subjects are unaware of their own manipulation.\n\nParagraph 5:\nFinally, the quote serves as a call to action for those who seek", "\n\nAzure App Services is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft that allows developers to quickly build, deploy, and scale web applications and APIs in the cloud. It provides a fully managed environment for hosting web applications, including support for a variety of programming languages, databases, and operating systems.\n\nResource Groups:\n\nResource groups are a logical container for managing and deploying Azure resources. They provide a way to group related resources together, such as web apps, databases, and storage accounts, and manage them as a single unit. Resource groups can be used to enforce access control, apply tags for cost management and monitoring, and simplify the deployment and management of resources.\n\nPlans:\n\nApp Service plans define the compute resources and scaling options for web apps and APIs deployed to Azure App Services. There are several types of plans available, including:\n\n* Free: A basic plan that allows you to host a web app or API for free, with limited resources and features.\n* Shared: A low-cost plan that shares resources with other web apps and APIs, providing a cost-effective option for small-scale applications.\n* Dedicated: A plan that provides dedicated resources for a single web app or API, offering better performance and scalability.\n* Virtual Machine Scale Sets: A plan that allows you to scale out your web app or API by deploying multiple virtual machines (VMs) and load balancing traffic across them.\n* Container Instances: A plan that allows you to run your web app or API in a container, providing a lightweight and scalable option for containerized applications.\n\nRelationships:\n\nResource groups, plans, and web applications are all related in the following ways:\n\n* A resource group can contain one or more App Service plans, and each plan can host one or more web apps or APIs.\n* When you create a new web app or API, you must specify an App Service plan to host it.\n* You can move a web app or API between App Service", "\n\n---\n\nSubject: KSAA Newsletter Submission - University of Auckland\n\nDear Hyein,\n\nI am writing to submit our team's achievements for the KSAA newsletter.

We can assist in generating code snippets, suggest solutions to coding problems, or help explain complex code, but we don't have the ability to fully understand the context, dependencies, and potential errors in a way that would allow us to write complete, production-ready code.\n\nHowever, there are ongoing research efforts in the field of Programming by Example (PbE) and Code-Tuning, where NLP models are used to help automate coding tasks. These models are trained on large datasets of code and related documentation, allowing them to suggest code based on the problem description. But even these models are not perfect and require human oversight to ensure the generated code is correct and efficient.\n\nIn the future, as AI technology continues to advance, we may see NLP models that can write complete, error-free code, but we're not there yet.

This is also known as virtual memory.\n\nWhen a process needs more memory than is currently available in the RAM, the operating system swaps out (or pages out) some of the less frequently used data or programs from the RAM to the hard disk. This frees up memory for the process that needs it. Later, when the swapped-out data or program is needed again, it is swapped back (or paged in) into the RAM.\n\nSwapping can help to improve system performance by allowing more processes to run concurrently than would be possible if all processes had to be loaded into RAM at once. However, swapping can also cause performance issues if it is", " I can't wait to see you there!", "", "?\n\nIn Django, you can create a ManyToMany relationship between two models using the `ManyToManyField`.

What is the primary goal of the charter operator in this scenario?\n   - The primary goal of the charter operator is to efficiently manage their fleet, match customers with flights based on their preferences, and fill empty seats to maximize revenue.\n\n2. How can we gamify the charter operator's experience on the dashboard?\n   - By introducing elements such as leaderboards, achievements, and rewards for meeting certain performance metrics, such as filling a certain percentage of seats or maintaining a high customer satisfaction rating.\n\n3. How can we incentivize customers to take empty seats on flights?\n   - By offering discounts or rewards in the form of tokens for booking empty seats, or by creating a marketplace where customers can bid on empty seats.\n\n4. How can we automatically match customers with flights based on their preferences?\n   - By using machine learning algorithms to analyze customer data, such as their location, destination preferences, and travel history, and using this information to make recommendations for flights.\n\n5. How can we use the ERC-20 token in this scenario?\n   - The token can be used as a form of currency within the platform, allowing customers to purchase flights, bid on empty seats, and earn rewards for taking certain actions, such as booking a flight at the last minute or referring a friend.\n\n6. How can we create a marketplace for other service providers within the platform?\n   - By allowing service providers, such as catering companies or ground transportation services, to create profiles and offer their services to customers. Customers can then book these services directly through the platform using the ERC-20 token.\n\n7. How can we visualize the charter operator's fleet on the dashboard?\n   - By using a map interface that shows the location of each aircraft in real-time, as well as information about the status of each flight, such as the number of seats available and the estimated time of departure.\n\n8. How can we allow the charter operator to adjust prices or give incentives to keep their operation running smoothly?\n   - By providing tools that allow the charter operator to easily adjust the price of a flight based on factors such as the number of seats available and the time remaining before departure. The operator can also offer incentives, such as discounts or rewards, to customers who book at the last minute or fill empty seats.\n\n9. How can we make the dashboard easy to use for the charter operator?\n   - By designing a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate, and by providing clear and concise information about the status of each flight and the performance of the operation as a whole.\n\n10. How can we measure the charter operator's performance on the dashboard?\n   - By using key performance indicators (KPIs) such as the number of flights operated, the number of seats filled, and the customer satisfaction rating. These KPIs can be displayed on the dashboard in the form of charts and graphs, and the charter operator can use this information to identify areas for improvement.\n\n11. How can we make the dashboard engaging and fun for the charter operator?\n   - By incorporating elements such as leaderboards, achievements, and rewards, and by using gamification techniques such as progress bars and visual feedback to keep the charter operator motivated and engaged.\n\n12. How can we ensure that the dashboard is secure and protects the charter operator's data?\n   - By implementing strong security measures, such as encryption and two-factor authentication, and by following best practices for data protection and privacy.\n\n13. How can we make the dashboard accessible to the charter operator from anywhere?\n   - By making the dashboard available as a web application that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, and by providing a mobile app for iOS and Android devices.\n\n14. How can we make the dashboard scalable to accommodate a growing charter fleet?\n   - By using", " and nature, it is adulterated.\n\nIn other words, if a product is made to look like another product and is sold under the same name, but it is not the same product, it is considered adulterated.

However, you can use a workaround by using an image as the background and overlaying the text and other elements on top of it. Here's a simple example of how you can do this:\n\n1. First, you need an image with a transparent background. You can create one using tools like Adobe Photoshop, GIMP, or even online tools like Canva.\n\n2. Upload this image to a SharePoint library, OneDrive, or any other storage service that Power Automate can access.\n\n3. In your Power Automate flow, add a 'Compose' action to get the URL of the image.\n\n4. Add another 'Compose' action to create the adaptive card. You'll need to use JSON to structure the card. Here's a simple example:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\",\n    \"body\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"Image\",\n            \"url\": \"your_image_url\",\n            \"style\": \"stretch\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n            \"text\": \"Your text here\",\n            \"wrap\": true\n        }\n    ],\n    \"actions\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"Action.Http\",\n            \"title\": \"Action\",\n            \"url\": \"your_action_url\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nReplace `\"your_image_url\"` with the URL you got in the first 'Compose' action, and `\"Your text here\"` and `\"your_action_url\"` with your actual text and action URL.\n\n5. Send this adaptive card as an output.\n\nThis will create an adaptive card with your image as the background and text overlaid on top of it.
