It's a fantastic book that helps entrepreneurs and business leaders create a clear plan for their company. The book is based on the Entrepreneurial Operating System (EOS), which is a simple, yet powerful framework for building a successful business.\n\nOne of the key concepts in Traction is the idea of a \"rock.\" A rock is a specific, measurable goal that you want to achieve in a specific timeframe. Rocks are used to focus the company on what's most important and to create a sense of urgency around achieving those goals.\n\nIn this episode, I'm going to share my own experience with using rocks", "\n\nHere is a simple example of how you can create a Rust application that uses the ElevenLabs API to read the contents of the clipboard aloud using TTS:\n\nFirst, add the following dependencies to your `Cargo.toml` file:\n```\n[dependencies]\nelevenlabs-api = \"0.1.0\"\ntts = \"0.3.0\"\n```\nThen, create a new Rust file (e.g. `main.rs`) and add the following code:\n```\nuse elevenlabs_api::ElevenLabs;\nuse tts::TTS;\n\nfn main() {\n    // Initialize the ElevenLabs API\n    let api_key = \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\";\n    let api_secret = \"YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE\";\n    let eleven_labs = ElevenLabs::new(api_key, api_secret);\n\n    // Initialize the TTS engine\n    let tts = TTS::new();\n\n    // Get the contents of the clipboard\n    let clipboard_contents = std::env::var(\"clipboard_contents\").unwrap();\n\n    // Use the ElevenLabs API to read the contents of the clipboard aloud\n    let response = eleven_labs.read_text(clipboard_contents);\n\n    // Convert the response to a string\n    let response_str = response.text().unwrap();\n\n    // Use the TTS engine to read the response aloud\n    tts.speak(response_str);\n}\n```\nReplace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` and `YOUR_API_SECRET_HERE` with your actual ElevenLabs API key and secret.\n\nThis code uses the `elevenlabs-api` crate to interact with the ElevenLabs API, and the `tts` crate to read the response aloud. It gets the contents of the clipboard using the `std::env::var` function, and then uses the ElevenLabs API to read the contents aloud. Finally, it uses the TTS engine to read the response aloud.\n\nNote that this is just a simple example, and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific use case. Additionally, you will need to install the `tts` crate and its dependencies using `cargo build` and `cargo run` commands.\n\nAlso, you can use `clipboard` crate to get the clipboard contents, it's a cross-platform crate that allows you to read and write the clipboard contents.\n```\nuse clipboard::Clipboard;\n\nfn main() {\n    let clipboard = Clipboard::new();\n    let contents = clipboard.get_text().unwrap();\n    // ...\n}\n```\nYou can add the `clipboard` crate to your `Cargo.toml` file like this:\n```\n[dependencies]\nclipboard = \"0.4.0\"\n```\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.", ". Also, you need to add more details about the filters, like what they do and how they work.\nHere is the new version:\n\n**Second Draft**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThis document outlines the design and implementation of a new feature for the [Application Name]. The feature is designed to provide a more efficient and user-friendly way to filter and sort data.\n\n**Filters**\n\nThe filters are a crucial part of the feature, allowing users to narrow down the data to specific criteria. There are three types of filters:\n\n### 1. **Category Filter**\n\nThe Category Filter allows users to filter data by category. This filter works by:\n\n* Retrieving a list of categories from the database\n* Displaying the list of categories in a dropdown menu\n* Allowing users to select one or more categories\n* Filtering the data to show only the records that match the selected categories\n\n### 2. **Date Filter**\n\nThe Date Filter allows users to filter data by date range. This filter works by:\n\n* Retrieving a list of dates from the database\n* Displaying the list of dates in a calendar view\n* Allowing users to select a start and end", "?\nIn the JTBD (Job To Be Done) context, a \"push\" refers to a situation where a customer is motivated to take an action because they are being pushed or driven by an internal or external force.\nIn other words, a push is when a customer is compelled to take a specific action because of a need, desire, or obligation that is driving them to do so. This can be due to various factors such as:\nA need or want that is not being met\nA problem or pain point that needs to be solved\nA desire to achieve a specific goal or outcome\nA sense of obligation or responsibility\nA push can be triggered by various stimuli, such as:\nA customer's internal motivations, such as a desire to improve their health or achieve a personal goal\nExternal factors, such as a salesperson's pitch or a friend's recommendation\nA specific event or trigger, such as a birthday or a milestone\nWhen a customer is pushed to", "  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | ", " \n\nHere is the step by step guide:\n\n**Step 1: Create a new React App**\n\nOpen your terminal and run the following command to create a new React app:\n```\nnpx create-react-app my-app\n```\nThis will create a new directory called `my-app` with the basic structure for a React app.\n\n**Step 2: Create a new Node.js and Express.js Server**\n\nCreate a new file called `server.js` in the root of your project directory:\n```\ntouch server.js\n```\nAdd the following code to `server.js`:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\n\napp.use(express.json());\n\napp.get('/', (req, res) => {\n  res.send('Hello from Express!');\n});\n\napp.listen(3001, () => {\n  console.log('Server started on port 3001');\n});\n```\nThis code sets up an Express.js server that listens on port 3001 and responds to GET requests to the root URL with a simple \"Hello from Express!\" message.\n\n**Step 3: Create a RESTful API**\n\nCreate a new file called `api.js` in the root of your project directory:\n```\ntouch api.js\n```\nAdd the following code to `api.js`:\n```\nconst express = require('express');\nconst app = express();\nconst data = require('./data.json');\n\napp.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {\n  res.json(data);\n});\n\napp.post('/api/data', (req, res) => {\n  const newData = req.body;\n  data.push(newData);\n  res.json(newData);\n});\n\napp.put('/api/data/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = req.params.id;\n  const newData = req.body;\n  data.forEach((item, index) => {\n    if (item.id === parseInt(id)) {\n      data[index] = newData;\n    }\n  });\n  res.json(newData);\n});\n\napp.delete('/api/data/:id', (req, res) => {\n  const id = req.params.id;\n  data = data.filter((item) => item.id !== parseInt(id));\n  res.json({ message: 'Data deleted successfully' });\n});\n\napp.listen(3001, () => {\n  console.log('API server started on port 3001');\n});\n```\nThis code sets up a RESTful API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) data. The API uses the `data.json` file to store the data.\n\n**Step 4: Create a dummy data file**\n\nCreate a new file called `data.json` in the root of your project directory:\n```\ntouch data.json\n```\nAdd the following code to `data.json`:\n```\n[\n  {\n    \"id\": 1,\n    \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n    \"age\": 30\n  },\n  {\n    \"id\": 2,\n    \"name\": \"Jane Doe\",\n    \"age\": 25\n  }\n]\n```\nThis code creates a dummy data file with two objects.\n\n**Step 5: Connect the React App to the API**\n\nOpen the `index.js` file in your React app and add the following code:\n```\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';\nimport axios from 'axios';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [data, setData] = useState([]);\n  const [newData, setNewData] = useState({});\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    axios.get('http://localhost:3001/api/data')\n      .then((response) => {\n        setData(response.data);\n", " You may need to adjust the scheduling interval,", " The end.", "\n\n\n\n**Assistant**\n\n\n\n**", "\n\nWhat is the meaning of \"test\"?\nWhat are the synonyms for \"test\"?\nWhat is the definition of \"test\" in the context of a series of questions or exercises?", " [duplicate]\n\nThis question already has an answer here:\n\n  - Maven pom.xml template for a simple Java project 2 answers\n\nHere is a basic Maven pom.xml template for a Java project:\n\n```xml\n<project xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\"\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\">\n    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>\n\n    <groupId>com.example</groupId>\n    <artifactId>my-java-project</artifactId>\n    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>\n    <packaging>jar</packaging>\n\n    <name>My Java Project</name>\n    <description>This is a sample Java project.</description>\n\n    <properties>\n        <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>\n        <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>\n    </properties>\n\n    <dependencies>\n        <!-- Add your dependencies here -->\n    </dependencies>\n\n    <build>\n        <plugins>\n            <plugin>\n                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>\n                <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>\n                <version>3.8.1</version>\n                <configuration>\n                    <source>1.8</source>\n                    <target>1.8</target>\n                </configuration>\n            </plugin>\n        </plugins>\n    </build>\n</project>\n```\n\nThis template includes:\n\n* The project's group ID, artifact ID, version, and packaging.\n* The project's name and description.\n* Properties for the Java compiler source and target versions.\n* A section for adding dependencies.\n* A build", "\n\n\nNote: The target persona and target search phrase are based on the assumption that the article is intended for a general audience.

The temperature sensor is used to measure the temperature, and the potentiometer is used to control the brightness of the LCD display. The query is related to Arduino, as the provided search results suggest.\n\nTo create an LCD control system using a potentiometer and temperature sensor, the following steps can be followed:\n\n1. Install the necessary libraries: The LiquidCrystal I2C library is required to communicate with the LCD display. This library can be installed using the Arduino IDE [[2](https://arduinogetstarted.com/tutorials/arduino-display-temperature-from-lm35-sensor-on-lcd)].\n2. Connect the components: The temperature sensor (LM35) should be connected to the analog input pin A0 of the Arduino board. The potentiometer should be connected to the analog input pin A1 of the Arduino board. The LCD display should be connected to the digital pins of the Arduino board.\n3. Write the code: The code should include the necessary libraries and functions to read the temperature from the LM35 sensor, read the potentiometer value, and display the temperature and brightness on the LCD display. The code can be written using the Arduino IDE.\n4. Upload the code: The code should be uploaded to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.\n5. Test the system: The system should be tested by connecting the temperature sensor and potentiometer to the Arduino board and powering it on. The temperature and brightness should be displayed on the LCD display.\n\nThe following code can be used as a starting point:\n```c\n#include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>\n\nconst int lcdRS = 12;\nconst int lcdEN = 11;\nconst int lcdD4 = 5;\nconst int lcdD5 = 4;\nconst int lcdD6 = 3;\nconst int lcdD7 = 2;\n\nconst int tempPin", " According to a survey conducted by the American Bible Society, the most quoted biblical verse is John 3:16, which reads, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes", "?\nYou can use the `localeCompare()` method to sort strings in a case-sensitive manner. This method compares two strings and returns a value indicating their relative order. The value is a negative number if the first string is less than the second, zero if they are equal, and a positive number if the first string is greater than the second.\n\nHere is an example:\n```\nconst arr = ['hello', 'Hello', 'HELLO'];\n\narr.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));\n\nconsole.log(arr); // Output: [\"Hello\", \"hello\", \"HELLO\"]\n```\nIn this example, the `localeCompare()` method is used to compare each pair of strings in the array. The method returns a negative value if the first string is less than the second, zero if they are equal, and a positive value if the first string is greater than the second. The `sort()` method uses these values to sort the array in a case-sensitive manner.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `toLowerCase()` or `toUpperCase()` method to convert all strings to a consistent case before sorting. For example:\n```\nconst arr = ['hello', 'Hello', 'HELLO'];\n\narr.sort((a, b) => a.toLowerCase().localeCompare(b.toLowerCase()));\n\nconsole.log(arr); // Output: [\"hello\", \"Hello\", \"HELLO\"]\n```\nIn this example, the `toLowerCase()` method is used to convert each string to", "swift\n@available(iOS 9.0", " \n\nThe book I am following is \"Effective Modern C++\" by Scott Meyers and it says that this is a new feature in C++20. \n\nI am using Visual Studio 2019 which is supposed to support C++20. \n\nWhat am I missing? \n\nPlease help. \n\nThank you. \n\nHere is the enum definition:\n\nenum class Operation {\n add,\n subtract,\n multiply,\n divide\n};\n\nI have also tried to use the following code:\n\ndouble calculate(Operation op, double num1, double num2) {\n enum class Operation {\n  add,\n  subtract,\n  multiply,\n  divide\n };\n switch (op) {\n case add:\n return num1 + num2;\n case subtract:\n return num1 - num2;\n case multiply:\n return num1 * num2;\n case divide:\n return num1 / num2;\n }\n}\n\nBut it", "\nProduct designers are responsible for creating and improving the design of products, from concept to production. Here's an overview of the process:\n1. Research and Analysis:\nProduct designers start by researching the market, competitors, and customer needs to identify opportunities for innovation and improvement. They analyze the product's functionality, usability, and aesthetics to identify areas for improvement.\n2. Concept Development:\nBased on the research and analysis, product designers develop concepts for the product. They create sketches, prototypes, and computer-aided designs (CAD) models to visualize the product's design.\n3. Design Development:\nThe product designer refines the design concept, considering factors such as functionality, usability, and aesthetics. They create detailed designs, including specifications, materials, and manufacturing processes.\n4. Prototyping:\nProduct designers create prototypes of the product to test its functionality, usability, and aesthetics. They may use various materials and manufacturing processes to create the prototype.\n5. Testing and Feedback:\nThe product designer tests the prototype with users, gathering feedback on the product's performance, usability, and aesthetics.

The `input_file` parameter specifies the path to the input CSV file, the `output_file` parameter specifies the path to the output CSV file, and the `parse_rules` parameter is a list of dictionaries that specify the parse rules to apply to each row of the input file.\n\nThe `parse_rules` list contains dictionaries with two keys: `column_index` and `regex`. The `column_index` key specifies the index of the column to extract data from, and the `regex` key specifies the regular expression to use to extract the data.\n\nThe `parse_csv` function opens the input file and creates a CSV reader object, then iterates through the rows in the input file. For each row, it applies the parse rules specified in the `parse_rules` list and extracts the desired data. The extracted data is then written to the output file using a CSV writer object.\n\nIn the example code, the `parse_rules_list` variable defines a list of parse rules to apply to the input file. The first rule extracts the first column of the input file and applies a regular expression to extract a sequence of digits. The second rule extracts the second column of the input file and applies a regular expression to extract a date in the format `yyyy-mm-dd`. The third rule extracts the first column of the input file and applies a regular expression to extract a sequence of digits.\n\nThe `parse_csv` function is then called with the input file, output file, and parse rules list as arguments. The function extracts the data from the input file according to the parse rules and writes it to the output file.\n\nNote that this code assumes that the input file has a header row, and that the column indices specified in the parse rules are 0-based (i.e., the first column is column 0). If your input file does not have a header row, or if you need to use 1-based column indices, you will need to modify the code accordingly. Additionally, this code does not handle errors that may occur while reading or writing the input and output files, so you may want to add error handling code to make the program more robust.", ": A Survey\nEmbedding is a fundamental concept in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

I have an entity that has a field that should store JSON data. What type should I use for this field in the entity?\n\nAccording to the TypeORM documentation, you can use the `Json` type for this purpose. Here is an example:\n```\nimport { Entity, Column } from 'typeorm';\nimport { Json } from 'typeorm/json';\n\n@Entity()\nexport class MyEntity {\n  @Column('json')\n  myJsonField: Json;\n}\n```\nThe `Json` type is a built-in type in TypeORM that represents a JSON value. It is compatible with PostgreSQL's `json` data type.\n\nAlternatively, you can also use the `Jsonb` type, which is similar to `Json` but is more efficient for storing and querying JSON data:\n```\nimport { Entity, Column } from 'typeorm';\nimport { Jsonb } from 'typeorm/json';\n\n@Entity()\nexport class MyEntity {\n  @Column('jsonb')\n  myJsonbField: Jsonb;\n}\n```\nThe `Jsonb` type is also compatible with", "?\n\nFor example, if the string is \"hello123world456\", the regex should return \"123\".\n\nHere is a simple regex that should work:\n\n```javascript\nvar str = \"hello123world456\";\nvar regex = /^\\d+/;\nvar match = str.match(regex);\nconsole.log(match[0]); // Outputs: \"123\"\n```\n\nThis regex `^\\d+` matches one or more digits (`\\d+`) at the start of the string (`^`). The `^` character is an anchor that means \"start of the string\", and the `\\d+` matches one or more digits. The `+` is a quantifier that means \"one or more of the preceding element\".\n\nIf you want to match the first set of numbers in the string, regardless of its position, you can use the following regex:\n\n```javascript\nvar str = \"hello123world456\";\nvar regex = /\\d+/;\n", " For example:\n```\ncsc.exe /target:library /out:My", " Here's an example implementation:\n```ruby\nclass SettingsController < ApplicationController\n  def edit\n    @weekly_allowance = current_user.weekly_allowance\n  end\n\n", "?\nDetermining the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines involves several steps and criteria. Here are some of the key methods used to evaluate their performance:\n1. Phase III clinical trials: Before a vaccine is approved for use, it undergoes rigorous testing in large-scale clinical trials, known as Phase III trials. These trials involve thousands of participants who receive either the vaccine or a placebo. The trials are designed to assess the vaccine's ability to prevent severe illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19.\n2. Efficacy: Efficacy is the percentage of participants who develop COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine compared to those who receive a placebo. A vaccine is considered effective if it reduces the risk of developing COVID-19 by at least 50%.\n3. Vaccine effectiveness: Vaccine effectiveness is the percentage of participants who develop COVID-19 after receiving the vaccine, compared to those who do not receive the vaccine. This is often measured in real-world settings, such as in healthcare systems or communities.\n4. Surveillance: Surveillance involves monitoring the spread of COVID-19 in populations that have received the vaccine. This helps to identify any potential issues or side effects and to track the vaccine's effectiveness over time.\n5. Case-control studies: Case-control studies involve comparing individuals who have developed COVID-19 (cases) with those who have not (controls).

In this case, it's '52,+1'. You can fix this by removing the non-numeric characters from the signal strength before converting it to an integer. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```\ndef get_available_networks():\n    network_list = []\n    with open('/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport.log', 'r') as f:\n        for line in f:\n            if 'Network' in line:\n                network = line.strip()\n                columns = network.split()\n                ssid = columns[1]\n                signal = int(''.join(filter(str.isdigit, columns[2])))\n                network_list.append({\"ssid\": ssid, \"signal\": signal})\n    return network_list\n```\n\nIn this code, `filter(str.isdigit, columns[2])` is used to filter out the non-numeric characters from the signal strength, and `''.join(...)` is used to join the remaining characters back into a string.

It also initializes `current_sum` to 0 and `max_length` to 0. It then iterates over the array with the `right` pointer, adding each element to `current_sum`. If `current_sum` exceeds `k`, it subtracts the element at the `left` pointer from `current_sum` and moves the `left` pointer to the right. If `current_sum` is less than or equal to `k`, it updates `max_length` if the current window is larger. Finally, it returns `max_length`.\n\nThis function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array, and a space complexity of O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space. It works for all edge cases, including an empty array, an array with a single element, and an array with all elements equal to `k`. It also works for arrays with negative numbers and arrays with duplicate elements.

Cut the potatoes into long, thin strips. You can either cut them by hand or use a French fry cutter.\n2. Rinse the potato strips in cold water to remove excess starch, then dry them thoroughly with paper towels.\n3. Heat the vegetable oil in a deep frying pan or a deep fryer to a temperature of around 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).\n4. Carefully add the potato strips to the hot oil in batches, being careful not to overcrowd the pan.\n5. Fry the potatoes for around 3-5 minutes, or until they are golden brown and crispy.\n6. Remove the frites from the oil with a slotted spoon and place them on a paper towel-lined plate to drain excess oil.\n7. Sprinkle the frites with salt and any additional seasonings you like.\n8.

If the instance is not running or does not have the specified tag, the `ec2_tag` module will not be able to retrieve the tag and the playbook will fail. \n\nYou can also use `ec2_tag` module with `when` condition to check if the tag exists before trying to use it:\n\n```\n- name: Get ec2 tag\n  ec2_tag:\n    region: 'your_region'\n    filters:\n      'instance-state-name': 'running'\n    tag: 'my_tag'\n  register: ec2_tag\n  when: ec2_tag.tag is defined\n``", " - New and Fresh Private + Public Proxies Lists Everyday!\nwhat are the best camera and lighting settings for YouTube when using the bmpcc 6k?\nI'm planning to create a YouTube channel and I'm using the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera 6K (BMPCC 6K) as my camera. I'm looking for the best camera and lighting settings for YouTube. I've read some articles and watched some tutorials, but I'm still unsure about the best settings for my camera and lighting.\nHere are some general guidelines for camera settings:\n1. Resolution: 4K (3840 x 2160) or 6K (6144 x 3456) depending on your needs and the type of content you're creating.\n2. Frame rate: 24fps or 25fps for a cinematic look, or 30fps or 60fps for a more fast-paced look.\n3. Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 or 1.85:1 for a cinematic look, or 16:9 for a more modern look.\n4. Color profile: Log or flat profile for more flexibility in post-production, or a color profile that matches your desired color palette.\n5. ISO: 400-1600 for most indoor and outdoor scenes, or 100-400 for low-light scenes.\n6. White balance: Auto or set to a specific color temperature (e.g. 5600K for daylight) depending on your lighting conditions.\n7. Exposure: Adjust the exposure to your liking, but be careful not to overexpose or underexpose your footage.\n\nHere are some general guidelines for lighting settings:\n1. Natural light: Use natural light whenever possible, especially for outdoor scenes. Position your subject near a window or outside during the golden hour (the hour just before sunset) for a warm, soft light.\n2. Artificial light: Use artificial light sources such as LED panels, softboxes, or ring lights for indoor scenes. Position the light sources to create a flattering, soft light on your subject's face and body.\n3. Color temperature: Use light sources with a color temperature that matches your desired color palette. For example, use warm-toned lights (e.g. 2800K-3200K) for a cozy, intimate look, or cool-toned lights (e.g. 5600K-6500K) for a bright, modern look.\n4. Softbox vs. hard light: Use softbox lights for a soft, diffused light, or hard light sources (e.g. LED panels) for a more dramatic, high-contrast look.\n5. Lighting ratio: Use a lighting ratio of 2:1 or 3:1 for a more natural, balanced look, or a higher ratio for a more dramatic, high-", " of the article.\nHere is the article:\n\n\"The world is a mess, and it's not just the politicians who", " What are the key features I should include in my SaaS?\nI want to build a SaaS where small/new sellers can get recommendations for what products they should sell based on what can maximize profit, while taking into account their selling style, lifestyle, capacity and any other preferences or attributes of the seller.\nYour competitors:\n1.

When a process requests more memory than is available, the operating system may swap out some of the process's pages to disk, freeing up memory for the process to continue running. Swapping is also known as paging or virtual memory management.\nHere's how swapping works:\n1. The operating system identifies a process that requires more memory than is available.\n2. The operating system identifies a page of the process's memory that can be swapped out to disk.\n3. The operating system writes the page to disk, freeing up memory for the process to continue running.\n4. The operating system updates the process's memory map to reflect the swapped-out page.\n5.

The `AdaptiveCard` control only supports a limited set of properties, and background color is not one of them.\n\nAs a workaround, you can use a `Container` control with a background color set to achieve a similar effect. Here's an example:\n```\nContainer(\n    {\n        BackgroundColor: \"Blue\",\n        Height: 200,\n        Width: 300,\n        Items: {\n            AdaptiveCard(\n                {\n                    \"$schema\": \"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json\",\n                    \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\",\n                    \"version\": \"1.2\",\n                    \"body\": [\n                        {\n                            \"type\": \"TextBlock\",\n                            \"text\": \"Hello World!\",\n                            \"size\": \"Medium\",\n                            \"color\": \"Accent\"\n                        }\n                    ]\n                }\n            )\n        }\n    }\n)\n```\nThis will create a blue container with an adaptive card inside. You can adjust the `Height` and `Width` properties of the container to fit your needs.\n\nI hope this helps!

When you hover over another `Tooltip` component, it will open a new tooltip and close the previous one. And so on.", ".\n\nWe know that the sum of two independent exponential random variables is also an exponential random variable. The rate parameter of the resulting exponential random variable is the sum of the rate parameters of the two original exponential random variables.\n\nThe rate parameter of the exponential random variable X is 7, and the rate parameter of the exponential random variable Y is also 7. Therefore, the rate parameter of the exponential random variable W = X + Y is 7 + 7 = 14.\n\nThe PDF of W is therefore 14e^(-14w).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 14e^(-14w).
