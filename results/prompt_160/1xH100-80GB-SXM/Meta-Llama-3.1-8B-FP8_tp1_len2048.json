I'm not sure how to use the ec2_tag module to get the ec2 tag information and then use that information to change the jinja2 template. Any help would be appreciated.\nYou can use the ec2_tag module to get the ec2 tag information and then use that information to change the jinja2 template. Here is an example of how you can do this:\n  1. First, you need to create a variable that will hold the ec2 tag information. You can do this by using the ec2_tag module and specifying the tag key and value that you want to retrieve. For example:\n- name: Get ec2 tag information\n  ec2_tag:\n    resource: \"{{ ec2_instance_id }}\"\n    tag_key: \"MyTagKey\"\n    tag_value: \"MyTagValue\"\n  register: ec2_tag_info\n  vars_prompt:\n    name: ec2_instance_id\n    prompt: \"Enter the EC2 instance ID\"\n    private: no\n  when: ec2_instance_id is defined\n  tags: ec2_tag\n  1. Next, you need to create a variable that will hold the jinja2 template. You can do this by using the template module and specifying the template file that you want to use. For example:\n- name: Get jinja2 template\n  template:\n    src: \"my_template.j2\"\n    dest: \"/tmp/my_template.j2\"\n  register: jinja2_template\n  tags: jinja2_template\n  1. Finally, you need to use the ec2_tag_info variable to change the jinja2 template. You can do this by using the set_fact module and specifying the jinja2 template variable. For example:\n- name: Change jinja2 template\n  set_fact:\n    jinja2_template: \"{{ jinja2_template | replace('MyTagValue', ec2_tag_info.tag_value) }}\"\n  tags: jinja2_template\nIn this example, we are using the replace filter to replace the value of the MyTagValue variable in the jinja2 template with the value of the ec2_tag_info.tag_value variable. You can modify this example to suit your specific needs.\nI hope this helps!
